            "title": "The luck positioning attribute",
            "content": "An NPC trying to position itself for the best luck possible. Credits to Happy new year 2023 everyone! I hope readers had a chance to celebrate, wind down or simply relax. Though the world doesn’t miraculously change it’s outlook or trajectory overnight, people do have a tendency to treat new years as a fresh start of sorts (you can google the fresh start effect). Indeed, who wouldn’t hope, or aspire, to be able to make life better going forward. And yet we may also feel that we will have no such luck going forward. So in this post let us talk about luck and make it less mystical and hopefully more attainable. . A digression to games . I love playing JRPGs (japanese role-playing games). Most of these games have some form of fighting mechanic where the player can play characters that have specific attributes. One such attribute is Luck. Most of the time the Luck attribute only has influence over probabilistic battle mechanics, such as the probability of dealing a critical hit. . Landing a critical hit leads to dealing significantly more damage, usually by 1.25 to 2 times harder than usual. But damage is largely affected by the Attack attribute. So imagine a character that pulls of a critical hit but it can only deal a low amount damage because of a low Attack. That critical hit won’t seem so critical now… . Positioning for luck . Like how a critical hit is unimpressive without enough investment to Attack, lucky events alone are not enough. You need to be in position to make the most of it. . It is indisputable that life throws random events to us. And though we can try to anticipate, a combination of (un)known unknowns, randomness and imperfect information, events of chance happen. And when chances that we can capitalize for our benefit happen, don’t we then say we’re lucky? . A drawn lottery number is useless to us if we do not have the right lottery ticket, though drawing ANY of the lottery number is an unlikely random event. A new project that would benefit your promotion likelihood is great, but only if you’ve set yourself up to be a part of it. You may feel lucky to meet your life partner, but you needed to take the chance when you met them. . Luck being described to soccer players in the Blue Lock manga Working hard for luck . Try as we may to think that we have worked hard for the life we have now, chance, randomness and a plethora of things beyond our control showcase to us that the result of our life is not simply due to our actions. This may come as a sense of reprieve for those who feel like they are given the short end of the stick in life. For those that have worked hard for the things in life, they may choose to give more credit to their efforts. And for those in the large middle they may feel stuck waiting for lady luck to chance upon them as they continue trying. . But effort and luck are complimentary to each other, not disjoint. To be in position to take advantage of chance, effort, whether small or large, will be needed. Paradoxically, the greatest differences may be due to the smallest of luck even after significant effort. . Athletes as an example . In his book Success and Luck, professor Robert H. Frank talks of highly competitive occupations e.g athletes, and how luck plays a crucial role in determining who would come ahead. If a group of athletes were to compete with each other, each of them are more than likely to be close in terms of skill, which we presume were developed through much effort. . We would think in such a competition, that the best of them would be the one to win. But if they were so close in skill, then the determining factor can be as small as a sliver of chance, perhaps it only makes a difference in 1 percent of cases. But such a small difference in chance can lead to a big difference of being first, or second. . Final words . Effort is important to make the most of luck, but luck relies on elemnts of chance. The more optimistic may see this as an opportunity of finding more luck in their life, but those with less optimism may question the efforts they are putting, if at the end it is luck (or a lack of it) that may determine the outcome. . Both are legitimate responses, but I would personally encourage the former than the latter. Indeed, it may be the determinant of you being lucky or not this year. .",

            "title": "A world of grace",
            "content": "First of all, Merry Christmas 2022 everyone! I hope you were able to spend time with your loved ones, or at least had the chance to take some reprieve from the busyness and frantic schedule that 2022 has imposed. In spirit of christmas I wanted to make this post, and excuse me ahead of time for a post that may seem to be a bit Christian centric. But I assure you this post is short and quick (no time return though, unlike gift shopping :sweat_smile:) . Googling grace, one of the definitions you get will be: . (in Christian belief) the free and unmerited favor of God, as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings. . Now this post won’t be talking about this specific definition of grace, but it’s definitely influenced. I want to talk about the grace of humans, in particular the grace that a human may display to one another (or in extension towards non-human entities). In Christian teachings, God shows grace through for the redemption of humanity from their sin in past, present, and future through Jesus Christ(-mas). Instead of this God-centric definition here’s the definition of grace that I will use: . a deliberate decision to not use one’s power over another party that will cause harm or pain or with no regard for the best of the other party . A bit lengthy, and you may think that this definition falls under “do no harm”/”do no evil”. Part of it is, but it goes beyond. Some examples may help: . not delivering judgement (behind/in front of them), despite moral high ground | not increasing prices when you have market dominance (similarly, not using a tight labour market to demand higher pay) | dropping our rights to make a claim in court towards anotheer who you feel have wronged you | embracing those deemed, implicitly or explicitly, not desirable in your group | not seeking tit-for-tat | delivering the best for others | make our resources for the benefits of others | Grace in my mind is not simply to not do something, but it is the active disposition to do the best, and give the best for other parties. It demands having others at the centre of our universe instead of ourselves. And to make it even more difficult, grace should be available for everyone and not just a select few. . Can a world where everyone show grace towards everyone exist? What would such a world like? I naturally think that such a world will be open to unscrupulous exploitation by some people who sees grace as a weakness ripe for picking. And economic and game theory teaches us that agents (humans) would prefer to favour their self-interest, opposite of what grace requires of us. Anecdotally, I know that I’m not that graceful either, and reading the comments and reactions to this Reddit thread seems to speak for the case of favouring self-interest. Even if it is achievable, would it be sustainable? And what conflicts or issues would arise from such a way of life? . But perhaps such a world would not the need ardent pursuit of self-interest. And such a world would naturally remove the desire to exploit. It may just be a chicken and egg situation in the end, and that it just takes the seemingly unlikely first step to be taken by us all. . Though it is difficult to envision such a world (or even it’s possibility), personally I believe it is a way of life worth striving for. Grace may not encompass all facet of our life, but we can see pockets of it sprinkled in our life. Yes, I’d like to believe that humans seek for grace, even though we may not know of it… .",

            "title": "What does a software developer do?",
            "content": "It has been a while readers! For the past year I have somewhat neglected my blog, but I assure you (or at least I hope I do) that it was for a good reason. You see for the past year or so I have been really focused at developing my career as a software developer in my current company (at least that’s what I’d rather say :sweat_smile:). Now that I feel like I would like to put up a new blog post, what could be more fitting than writing something about software development? . I’m sure most, if not all of us, have beeen asked with the too common question what do you do (for your job)? and you would answer with I work as a &lt;insert job title&gt;. And after you answer, you may feel an awkward stare that as if says great, but I still don&#39;t know what you do but both parties would nod in agreement to progress the conversation to some other topic. As a software developer I’ve always had a bit of difficulty explaining what being a software deeveloper means to most people around me considering that most are not realted to software development and have little knowledge with the profession. But throughout this year I have had a bit of time to think this question through and I feel like I have come to a satisfying explanation which I’d like to share: . A software developer is a profession that solves problems, with knowledge and the craft of software creation being their primary tool . … . You may now be on the verge of just closing this blog post altogether after having been served with answer that is seemingly both ambiguous and obvious and thus feeling like you have wasted your precious time reading 2.5 paragraphs. But I assure you (as again I would like to believe) that I have good reason for my answer. There are two: . The use of problem is intentionally worded as such to keep the scope of what a software developer can try to solve as wide as possible. | By claiming that software developers have a primary tool, it opens up the possibility of having secondary, tertiary and more tools beyond software creation to solve problems at hand | I think the first point is more self-evident. Software is abundant in our life and how much it influences our life through how, where, when and what we do whether we notice it nor not, to the point that some say that software is “eating up the world”. There are many kinds of problems to solve and while problem itself is undescriptive, if you were to tell others that you are solving a particular kind of problem I find that it becomes easier for people to have a sense of what you are doing. They may not know the intricacies nor how you solve the problem, but it provides them a concretee point to focus on, and if they’re interested I’m sure they’ll ask you more about it or do their own research . Now on the second point. As software developers we are expected to use our knowledge and skills to be able to develope (and maintain) software. It is what we are primarily paid for and how we are assessed, but that doesn’t mean that is the only way we can solve problems. Some problems are very likely better solved NOT using software but using some other set of tools (queue the people trying to solve everything with artificial intelligence/machine learning :see_no_evil:). That is to say, software developers have a hammer (software creation) but not everything is a nail to be hammered away . Now, to my fellow software developers I would like to encourage you to: . reflect on what kind of problems you are trying to solve, and what kind of problems you want to solve | how you can best use your software creation skills to tackle the problems | what other tools you can bring to the table to solve the problems? what kind of tools you would like to have (skills to develop)? | advocate for yourself to have the chance to get better at solving these problems, such as by seeking professional development support within and outside of software development | Hope readers enjoyed reading! .",

            "title": "Ohmmmm, that seems like the FED",
            "content": "Recently I have been dabbling a bit more into cryptocurrencies finding interesting projects and communities. Of course, there is the investment portion of it, but there is also the educational and pure interest part of it. Since I’ve been more into economics and finance lately and being a part of what media likes to call the digital generation, cryptocurrency has become more attractive as an interest. One of the most economically interesting cryptocurrency project that I have gotten to know is the [Olympus] project. What makes it interesting is that it is a project that is trying to become a monetary reserve system of Ethereum, that is, it is tyring to become a FED-like entity, with cryptocurrency and decentralization twist along with a different monetary policy outlook . In this post I would like to help readers (you) better understand Olympus’s economic models and their implications, to the best of my ability and understanding . Note that I will be using several cryptocurrency terminologies which may seem foreign to those that have never delved into cryptocurrencies before. Such terminologies will be italicized . Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with Olympus, nor do I own (at the time of this writing) any investments in Olympus’s products. I am not a financial advisor, and you should not take the content here as investment advise. The information and opinions in this post are solely mine, and are published for informational purposes . Ohm: A backed currency . Ohm is the currency circulated by Olympus. It is a currency that is backed against assets held in the Olympus treasury of which currently primarily consits of stablecoins, liquidity provider (LP) tokens, and several accepted cryptocurrencies. To be more precise, it is not the assets that Ohm is backed against, but a guaranteed amount of value that Ohm calls this the Risk-Free Value derived out of the market value of these assets. See RFV formula . So what does it mean to be backed? Is the value of Ohm supposed to equal the value or RFV of the assets? That’s not the case. In fact Olympus explicitly made it clear that Ohm is a free-floating currency with a market driven market rate. If Ohm’s value is enforced to be 1-to-1 correspondent to the value of the backing assets, it’s value will be $1. However, Olympus is giving a guarantee that every Ohm out there will always be redeemable for AT LEAST $1. This is the price floor of Ohm, or in other words its current intrinsic value to be $1. Theoretically in general, it is possible for the price floor of Ohm to be above $1 . Olympus makes this possible precisely because of the RFV in the treasury, that can be used to buy any circulating Ohm for $1, or theoretically in general any price floor e.g $100. Essentially, if Ohm’s price ever goes down below $1, a seller can go to Olympus and sell it for $1 which Olympus buys using the treasury assets it has accumulated. Additionally, by buying Ohm Olympus can remove the purchased Ohm out of circulation through a burning process (algorithmic removal of a token supply). So in addition to the price increase pressure from Olympus being a so-called buyer of last resorts, the price of the still circulating Ohm will eventually get back to its intrinsic value . Ohm: An inflationary currency . I mentioned previously how Ohm’s market price is free-floating and possibly above $1. The market price is the market price, it is a price that is determined by market outlook, sentiment and supply and demand. If Ohm is seen as a useful and productive currency, it’s price has a chance to go up. In fact, it is natural for such a currency to increase in price over time all else being equal. The USD for example, is a valuable currency used to transact across many countries and regimes around the world for all kinds of assets and commodities and used as various countries cash reserves. At times when there are high demand for the USD you would expect its price, relative to some other currency to increase. . While price increase sounds nice for primarily an investment asset, price increase relative to goods, services and other assets are deflationary. For example: . If with 10 Ohm you can buy 10 apples, but then the price of Ohm increases 10 times while the price of apples stays the same, then that same 10 Ohm can now buy 100 apples. The value of apples has deflated subjective to Ohm . The problem with deflation is that it encourages indefinite hoarding. If you are acclimated to prolonged a deflationionary pricing environment you would likely eventually be led to believe that deflation is the state of nature. The result is that you would start to believe that the asset that you hold will be worth more tomorrow than it is today, and your neighbours and everyone else with their assets would think the same. The rational next step is for everyone to not consume or divest the value of that asset and just hoard! But clearly this is problematic for a currency, whose objective is in large part to be spent! . In order to combat the deflationary aspect caused by a potential market price increase, Olympus has set out Ohm to be an inflationary currency, which means that Olympus literally mints more Ohm over time. In order to mint more Ohm, Olympus provides a staking program (covered more later), that gradually mints more Ohm at a variable rate. Essentially you can think of this as making a deposit into an account with a variable interest rate . Now, you may think that this is bad since the consequence of minting more of Ohm means that there is a price reduction pressure, and that is true! But this is a feature of Ohm, not a bug. The point of minting more of Ohm is to ensure an adequate supply of Ohm in the ecosystem. With an inflationary currency, or hence a deflationary currency in value, holders will be incentivized over time to spend Ohm instead of hoarding it. As Ohm is used more and more as a currency being used to transact and purchase goods and services, there will be more demand for Ohm. This demand will lead to some price increase support, but more importantly it requires Ohm to be present to be used widely and as conveniently as possible. Inflationary supply helps make that possible . Now lastly, remember the previous section where I talked about the RFV. While Olympus mints Ohm, it is algorithmically made to mint only to the point that the amount of Ohm in circulation matches the RFV in treasury. The reason is because 1 Ohm is backed by $1. Not minting more Ohm than the RFV would help ensure that every Ohm can be sold back for $1 . Staking: The monetary supply tool . Quick comparisons with the FED and modern monetary system . The FED is also the issuer of currency | The banks create money, Olympus is both reserve and money creator | Olympus says that it’s money is backed by real assets, USD is backed by nothing. This is not quite true since the USD can be seen as backed by future spending, and the production of the economy. Likewise, Olympus reserves backed by the belief in cryptocurrency economy, and hence likewise for Ohm | . Things to follow up on: . What happens to the APY and staking when the price of Ohm increases? | What happens to the APY and staking when the price of Ohm decreases? | .",

            "title": "Oh! Interesting... Week 1",
            "content": "1996 CRA Housing Study . Apparently in 1996 auditors of CRA (Canada Revenue Agency, the government body dealing with taxes and income) conducted a study on luxury residential properties being bought by new incoming immigrants in Burnaby, British Columbia | They found that a lot of luxury properties were bought by recent immigrants to Canada. In Burnaby for properties with that is &gt; $800,000 in purchasing value, 33 out of 48 buys in the sample were purchased by immigrants | Interestingly, the average declared income among these immigrants were considerably much lower than other groups sampled in the study. Some even declared their income to be negative | This raised questions surrounding potential tax evasion through global income, business or perhaps some convoluted loan schemes | The study was never truly publicized and allegedly ignored. It surfaced only after 5 years of a process called “Access to Information and Privacy” (ATIP) | One of the reasons that Canadians consider to be a factor to the ever increasing prices of residential properties is foreign buyers with greater purchasing power buying properties. This report will likely make their concerns even larger | At the same time the study was primarily focused on luxury properties, and at least based on the study itself there is no clear indication of how luxury property purchased with foreign money impact the overall property market | Original source that I read | . Rent control inefficacy . Rent control is sometimes proposed as part of a solution to combat housing unaffordability. But it may not be as desirable as one would think | Imposing rent control can lead to decrease in overall housing supply throughout the years that rent control is enforced. The reasons assume assumptions on the rational behaviour of landlords and real estate developers. Essentially due to the capped potential profit, suppliers have less incentive to supply properties as rentals and when this situation is prolonged it can lead to severe undersupply | At the same time rent control does positive effects on reducing the displacement of residents. In other words, residents can keep staying at the same place | However, rent control also disincentivizes people to move to other locations which may impede their economic mobility, but also further restricts the options of future incoming residents. Future residents are likely to have to find residence in a non-rent control place | Overall, rent control seems to benefit the immediate at the expense of future | And yet, removing rent control itself won’t be the best course of action given the likelihood of undersupply in areas with rent control. Removing rent control without other supporting actions would only serve to displace people and exacerbate the housing affordability problem | To me the whole debacle of housing affordability, from the lens of rent control, is a tragedy of the commons. All sides would like an outcome that suits their best interest but they often conflict with one another and decisions that tilt one favorably over another may be a short term net benefit but a long term problem. In this case the issuance of some versions of rent control may have ironically made things more unaffordable when moving forward into the future | Rent control also seems to be a rough attempt in creating the positive effects of land value tax | . Curation economy . The amount of content out there in the world to be consumed is ever expanding and inundates us with choice paralysis | But we desire to consume content as part of our ever digitalized life and media loving generation | There seems to be an increasing amount of willingness to pay for high quality content. These companies or ventures that thrive on the collection of curated content are called curators | From the author’s perspective, a curation must also be based on an underlying theme, that you can cultivate to a brand from | Some curators or forms of curation that come to my mind include: podcasts, Morning Brew, YouTube channels, Hiatus | This series in itself is a curation of things I found interesting | Non media content curation may include ventures like HelloFresh, and you may try to stretch that dating apps are also a form of curation | I wholly agree that curation is going to play a bigger role in our future of consumption as the number of content, and also poorly made ones, increase and get sieved through our perceptions, values, ideas and culture | . Negativity bias . Negativity bias is the tendency to focus on the negatives, more so on the positives. The higher amount of focus and attention given to negative events and aspects leads us to be more attentive and attracted, perhaps worryingly so, to such events dulling the positive impacts of positive events | This trait of us to focus on negative events seems to be understood as a form of generally true statement in psychology | You probably also notice that much of the news media, traditional or more contemporary like in our social media feeds, has a tendency to gravitate towards negative events. They know how to cash in on our attention | A general rule of thumb is that it takes 4 good things to offset the psychological impact of 1 bad thing | “Life has to win every day. Death only has to win once” - Roy Baumeister, psychologist. Our negativity bias may have come about from evolutionary needs to stay alive by avoiding the negative and even dangerous moments in life. Our ancestors had to live a life of struggle against the wilderness and spurious events that was literally life and death moments | If negativity bias was an evolutionary line of defense, it may not be as needed anymore in our modern days. Certainly the dangers of the wilderness is less faced by most of us. And we have systems and mechanisms in place, while imperfect, that are doing better at keeping us safe from what used to endanger our ancestors. | The focus on what is negative may make us lose sight of what is truly important and what is possible. This may lead us to sub-optimal decisions, whether in the short or long run | . Fairness as a Constraint on Profit Seeking . Economics 101 would tell you that what dictates price is the law of supply and demand. But while it is certainly fundamental in pricing mechanisms, it is not the only factor that influences pricing. Daniel Kahnemann et al. finds that rules of fairness puts certain limitations on how prices can move | The researches posited that when it comes to what is fair, consumers as market participants deem what is fair through an assessment that the researchers call the dual-entitlement view | Dual-entitlement view is the view that: It is not fair for suppliers of goods and services to charge a higher price if it means that transactors will incur at a loss. This applies EVEN IF there legitimate cost increases. Note that transactors in the study includes customers, tenants or employees | It is fair for suppliers of goods and services to gain profit by taking advantage of cost reductions, even if such cost reductions are not necessarily caused or induced by the suppliers | . | These are some hypotethical scenarios in the study that were deemed unfair, but would be possible through pure supply and demand mechanisms: A hardware store has been selling snow shovels for $15. The morning after a large snowstorm, the store raises the price to $20 . | A small photocopying shop has one employee who has worked in the shop for six months and earns $9 per hour. Business continues to be satisfactory, but a factory in the area has closed and unemployment has increased. Other small shops have now hired reliable workers at $7 an hour to perform jobs similar to those done by the photocopy shop employee. The owner of the photocopying shop reduces the employee’s wage to $7 . | . | The researchers claims that many people accounts loss and profit in what is called naive accounting. Naive accounting takes into account the reference pricing of the situation rather than the final end state of profit and loss. Rational pricing frameworks suggest what matters is the final end state, not the relative intermediate changes | They also noticed that people are more adverse to perceptions of loss than gains. | Perceptions of loss and gain along with naive accounting have significant impacts are significantly influenced by the framing of the situation. Even though the final accounting state may be the same, certain situations may be deemed unfair: A small company employs several people. The workers’ incomes have been about average for the community. In recent months, business for the company has not increased as it had before. The owners reduce the workers’ wages by 10 percent for the next year. . | A small company employs several people. The workers have been receiving a 10 percent annual bonus each year and their total incomes have been about average for the community. In recent months, business for the company has not increased as it had before. The owners eliminate the workers’ bonus for the year. . | In both scenarios the firm ends up with 10% in extra profit kept. However, the first scenario was deemed predominantly as unfair while the second one being fair by research participants | . | There are some economic consequences to the perceptions of fairness by market participants. Many of the ramifications that the researchers posited involve the failure of markets in delivering goods, services and labor at prices that supply and demand curve would suggest is appropriate. Inability to raise prices, or lower wages, in certain situations may lead to inbalances in the demand and supply that causes excess in one way or another. Economically speaking this leads to negative externalities | Some recent pricing events that come to my mind related to this study are: Shrinkflation, the practice of reducing amount of packaged goods but at the same price. Consumers are likely to be less perceptive in what seems to be neither gain nor loss, even though the end state, the price per unit may steadily increase | Canada’s housing is widely accepted to be undersupplied, and during the pandemic has skyrocketed in demand along with increased prices. Yet, in some online forums there are clear grievances and even bouts of anger and exclamations of unfairness. Clearly, there are some goods and services that can be increased in price but at the same time have a perception of unfairness imposed on them | It is widely accepted that technological advancements have led to an increased boom in productivity and consequently corporate revenues/profits. And technological advancements are not restricted to high growth tech companies, though it is certainly a major recipient and producer of it. But wages have predominantly stayed flat (in Canada, median and average employment income has barely moved). Is it because of perceived fairness? Or is it because of mostly unaware employees? I personally think the latter | . | I found about this study initially from reading Vitalik Buterin’s blog post on under pricing | .",

            "title": "I decided to fire myself",
            "content": "Introduction . Okay to start off, excuse my clickbaity title, but I feel that my title is appropriate (I’ll explain further down). So recently I changed my jobs after a long time of deliberation. Before deciding to change jobs, I actually had another opportunity to change jobs several months ago. At that time I finally decided to not change jobs at the time for several reasons. But the things I deliberated back then were either similar or related to the things I deliberated in my recent decision. In this blog post I would just like to share my experience and thoughts on this episode in my career . What made me consider changing jobs? . The decision to fire myself is inextricable from the considerations to change my job. So let’s start from there. . First of all, I liked my previous job’s co-workers. I also liked the product concept that the company is making and trying to iterate on. I liked my team. But there was a lack of alignment between what I felt was valued, and what I think is valuable. This misalignment turned to be the main catalyst. . I made lots of code and I enjoyed that. And besides coding I also did the following: . Devops | Best practices development | Processes improvement | CI/CD enhancement | AWS Resources Management | Establishing and iterating on code architecture | Trying to connect technical initiatives with business goals | Lunch and learns | I was doing what can be called as glue work, which in essence is all the things things that connect various aspects of the organization in order to make the software product and projects run well. I list these responsibilities not out of dislike, in fact I like to do most of them. But liking an activity is not the primary reason for taking responsibility on my shoulders. During a 1-on-1 session with my manager they asked me whether I liked to do more devops oriented work. My reply was: . I certainly do not dislike doing it. But more than liking it or not, I do it mainly because I find it necessary for the company’s quality and longevity . Necessity breeds invention they say. But while there were some level of acknowledgement of the importance of the above, there was a lack of targeted effort, attention and resources allocated to them. And for those that were allocated some resources, I felt they were lacking. It felt that that things were just barely holding on due to the efforts and attention given by a small number of people on glue work. . I understand that often resource allocation translates to capital allocation, which may or may not be feasible to distribute across so many necessities. But if that was the case, then I certainly expect management to step in and to work with the frontline engineers and business to align focus allowing for targeted resource allocation. I expect that gradually things would be given their due attention. If it was found that the business cannot shoulder the burden of working on so many priorities at the same time, then I expect management to make things feel and be manageable, even if that means de-prioritizing certain goals. . I expect all of these from an environment that aims to strive for lasting excellence and quality. And yet, I did not see the company move towards such an environment. . Firing myself . “Firing” is often seen as having a negative connotation, but my own framing of “firing” is a bit different. I had the chance to talk to my ex-CTO where I asked what skills they think are required for the company. One of the abilities they said they’d like to see from employees is the ability to fire people. What they meant is that there are going to be, for fortunate and unfortunate reasons, people that no longer align with the business. Misalignment between people and the company may include values, skills, results etc. Whatever the misalignment may be, my ex-CTO thought it is important to be able to let go of such people. . I wondered why I was unsure of whether to change jobs or not. In the end I came to realize that I was no longer delivering outputs that aligns to what the business values. I felt that my focus on tackling the challenges and tasks I listed above, clashed with what the company needed at the time. The company needed and seeked for more immediate business results that translates to clients’ success. Of course, I strived to bring success for our clients. I see my role as an engineer not to just create technology for the sake of itself, but to create technology that aligns with a greater purpose. In order to deliver those values I identified that the iterative and continous improvements on glue work were needed. Meanwhile, with the numerous projects accompanied with statically defined delivery schedules, as time goes on it became clearer that how I deliver value does not align with how the company delivers value. I knew there was a misalignment because though I often bring the topic of the need for continued organizational effort on glue work, I did not see changes materialize. . I knew that I was an integral part of the team. And I also knew that I am not in alignment with the company any longer. So instead of waiting for things to feel worse for both me and the company, I took the step to fire myself rather than prolong the situation. By firing myself I let the myself depart from the idealistic vision of what I think work should be like within the company. At the same time I also gave the opportunity to the company to re-allocate the resources and energy they spent on me towards others (potentially a new hire) that would better suit their needs. . Final thoughts . Overall, I am happy with my decision. Some may, and I did myself, argue that I should have stayed and try harder. If I really emphasized quality and really think what I did were important, then I should have aimed harder at creating buy in. I should reach further and connect people across the company. Or maybe, I should just have been a better communicator. . I do not disagree with such thoughts and I definitely see the merits of each. That’s why I hesitated to change jobs myself, questioning my own motives and decisions. But I realize that I may also be impeding not just my own growth, but perhaps the company’s growth too due to our misalignment. Additionally, by staying I may be delivering less impact than I can had I worked with an organization that aligns better with myself. Both sides have reasonable arguments depending on the situation and in the end I just chose what felt to be the best one. . While I do encourage everyone to seek to work for organizations (or even create ones) that aligns with themselves so that everyone can maximize their positive impact, I realize that the ability to fire oneself is a privilege. Not everyone will be able to nor afford to do it. I am certainly fortunate. Hence I hope employers continuously strive to onboard those that truly align with the organization but also be ready to adapt and shift to ensure that they themselves align with their workforce. It will require effort on all sides. . Thank you for reading thus far. I hope it has been valuable to you .",

            "title": "Part 1, Land Value Tax - Oh Canada, Why Is Your Land So Expensive?",
            "content": "Canada’s Housing Price . If you are a Canadian reader headlines of large price increases on real estate, particularly on housing real estate, is likely not foreign to you. In 2021. A quick search yields an article that says Canadian house prices rose by 31.6% from March 2020 (start of COVID-19 pandemic) to March 2021. . On another report, most major cities in Canada have had their highest real estate during the COVID-19 pandemic. The surge on real estate prices is taken note by Bank of Canada as a significant economic driving force with residiential real estate investment accounting for over 9% of gross domestic product. Increase in residential real estate prices, along with accomodative monetary policies such as low interest rates have prompted investments into residential real estate to slightly eclipse that of non-residential’s. Some are opining that Canada’s economiy is over-reliant on the residential real estate market, with investments on productive assets being thwarted by the chase on real estate investments. . In general, money goes where returns shine the brightest and certainly the Canadian housing market is shining bright hot in price. Considering residential, or housing’s, status of both as a consumption and asset it brings both pain and joy throughout the economy. For those that have entered into the real estate ownership, there is surely some joy having an asset that appreciates (though I personally contest this notion of housing as an asset). But for many, it can be painful thinking of ever growing house prices. . Price Reasoning . It has always perplexed me that house prices continue to rise especially if it does so in extraordinary numbers. Check out this Twitter thread for an infographic of how much Canada’s house prices have risen. The ever increasing housing price has continued to outpace income in growth making house affordability an increasing pain point throughout the country. You see it in headlines and probably have conversations with it online and offline. As someone that do not have their own house and who may (or may not) choose to buy one in the future in Canada, it is definitely a situation that is worrisome. Even if you are not planning to buy some housing property it is still an economical and social concern. For those in governing seats, it is likely a political concern too. What can we do about this? . To hope to answer the question we would need to assess reasons for why house prices have continued to grow. Some of the common reasons that I have seen and heard are: . Low interest rates | Discrepancy on supply and demand | Speculation money driving up prices | An accommodative government that will not tolerate house prices to drop | Increasing foreign investments or buyers | Hiding laundered money through buying properties | Pro-buying programs such as first time home owner | And then there is the classic - all of the above and more, which I agree is probably the case with each point having some degree of relevance. But on this series I would like to focus on the third reason, speculation. . Land and Speculation . What is it that is being speculated on with housing and how does that speculation get reflected in price? I think we can all agree that in general, over time a house’s condition will deteriorate if maintenance is not properly given. Much like a car that is used over time, it will lose its price as its value is eked over time. A house’s design has a certain of sense and fashion to it which may gain in popularity much like fashion and may come and go in popularity. But such ebb and flow in consumer taste is hardly a reason for an endemic increase in price. So neither the interior nor exterior quality of a house by in itself may drive us to speculate on its price. Then it must be something else, and based on the title of this article, it is the land of the house that can be speculated to increase in value and hence price. . For the most part, the available land to us is static and no one can truly produce more of it. Okay, maybe there are instances where land is “created” (or reclaimed) land like in the Netherlands or in Singapore, but these instances are few in contrast to the vast land that we have. Or perhaps you say that land is being lost due to land sinking based on effects of climate change. Okay find, but land sinking isn’t what we humans consciously work for in the economy like how you or I work at our jobs. Land, for the most part, is simply not something we produce, it’s supply is fixed (pre-dominantly) by what mother nature gives to us. . Then if land is fixed, supply and demand from economics 101 will tell us that price can only increase as a matter of demand. So when we speculate on the value of land we speculate that the price of land will increase as a function of higher demand. Why will a particular piece of land gain or lose demand? Because the land is surrounded by or removed of other valuable things (including other valuable land). The things of value built surrounding a particular land is a function of economic investments and market or community participation. Acknowledgement of the participation of a greater community is key to understand that the value of land is not beholden to anyone. . Land Value is Not Owned by Anyone . So let us recap: . Land’s supply is fixed and no person can increase or decrease its price through direct production | Land gains value by what it is surrounded by and the community and market that participates on it and it’s surrounding | Through these two observation we can claim that land’s value is not owned by anyone. Of course in a system of capitalism there is a notion of private ownership. Land itself can be privately owned for purposes such as building a business on top of it, or to live on it. But it’s value cannot be privately owned, because it’s value is not a function of one’s own work but that of mother nature’s and society as a whole. This is what Henry George argues for in his book Progress and Poverty. But our friend George here goes further than just defining land value, George wants to tax the land value we are standing and living on! . Land Value Tax and Speculation . George’s land value tax (LVT) is a simple proposal: put a tax on the value of the land. George goes further to say that LVT is the only tax that is needed to fund everything. He also contends that it is the most just tax to impose because no one owns the value of land (he allows land ownership, just not ownership over it’s value). . To make it even more starking George wants to tax 100% of the value of land. Partly again becasue of the no ownership over land value. Another reason is because George thinks that this would help dampen speculation. . Why would it be so? Well consider someone who is a house flipper that aims to buy some house property and sell it in a year or so. This person thinks that the price of the house will increase in the future without them needing to do improvements on top of it. To make it concrete say they bought for 500k CAD, and in a year they manage to sell for 600k CAD making a 100k revenue. Minus transaction costs and fees they may take home 50k in profit. But remember that they did not make any improvement to the property, thus the government can say that the price increase was wholly due to some land value increase. So through a 100% LVT they will be taxed on the full 50k profit or 100k revenue, depending on how the tax policy is enacted. No economic agent looking to make a profit will bother with flipping a house anymore because there is no profitable incentive to do so. . What if the flipper did decide to make some improvements to the house and sell higher based on the improvements? Then based on George’s LVT, they are entitled to the profits of their improvements. And since George advocates as LVT as the only tax, the profit from improvements will not be taxed. So if they made a 20k CAD improvement on the property, and sold it for 50k CAD, they are entitled on the full 30k profit. . Is LVT Feasible? . There are already some forms of LVT around the world, though not to the same degree that George laid it out. But there does seem to be government funding that is similar to essence with LVT. One such recent funding is Canada’s 5G broadband auction. While not deemed as tax, you can easily think of it as a one time tax for Canadian telecom providers that wish to supply 5G connectivity. . Just like how in LVT the government mandates that no one has ownership over land, the spectrum’s value is also not owned by anyone since they are simply leased through a license by the government. The spectrum’s value is for all, stewarded by the government in this case. The perception of the auction bids as a form of tax on future profits is also reflected in the stock market of the highest bidders . Final Thoughts . The encounter with LVT while thinking about what can be done about Canadian housing price has been a delight. I do think that LVT can be applied to try and curb the speculative sensation of the Canadian housing market. Dampening down speculation should help bring down, or at least keep house prices down at a reasonable price or growth rate. Meanwhile the proceeds from LVT can be used to fund public goods, and even perhaps a universal basic income as a way to disperse the riches of Canadian lands to the public. . In part 2 I will be briefly look at the economic and policy implications of LVT. .",

            "title": "Agile is Experimentation",
            "content": "Recently I had a conversation with two gents about software development and the word “Agile” propped up. As software engineers, or even business management these days, the word agile is everywhere. In job postings, in company slogans, in company talks, on our computer screens, and in our purported work values. But I know from personal feelings, observations and anecdotes there is some distaste to “Agile” and that it feels more as hype and even worse at times feels like a marketing tool to attract talent which sadly does not deliver. . So as per my usual inquiring-and-chatty-self I asked the two gents, “So, what does agile mean to you?”. And I purposefully directed the question to them through the vocabulary “you” because I want to understand their own personal mental model of Agile. I do not care about Scrum, Kanban or whatever new Agile framework out there is, I wanted to get to the fundamental of Agile. . The first said that for him Agile is all about doing breaking up the work and taking them up. He stated that the importance is not in the pointing mechanism itself, but more in actually being able to take up and do the work. The other said that Agile for him is all about the small iterative steps that is aimed for continuous refinement. . I think these kind of mental models of Agile is quite common. Generally they are surmised by these adjectives or nouns: ‘iterative’, ‘small’, ‘continuous improvement’. But I would like to further refine this understanding of iteration. So let’s do that in this post, let’s try to develop a better mental model of Agile. . Here is my take: . The main abstraction provided by Agile is experimentation . Experimentation first, the rest is by-product . As software engineers we love to abstract things away, to turn details into common patterns that can be encoded as a set of computer interactions (algorithms basically) to solve a problem, or class of problems. As a software engineer I posit that the main abstraction that Agile brings is experimentation in order to solve the problem of business development and innovation. . And when I say experimentation, I really mean experimentation as in the scientific method sense: . A picture of the scientific method, which is an on-going process. Source - Wikipedia Since I posit that Agile is really all about experimentation brought to business practice, then there are four elements that businesses adopting Agile must absolutely meet: . A hypothesis to test | Mechanisms to perform tests for or against the hypothesis | The gathering of, and capability to assess data | A commitment and understanding to learn and adapt continuously based on feedback of previous experiments | When viewing and applying Agile as experimentation through the scientific method towards business, iteration and continuous improvement is a given. It simply becomes a by-product. Small requires an additional perspective which I will touch later on, but I assure you that it remains a by-product. . On hypotheses and testing . Now I would like to touch on hypothesization and testing because as a software engineer this is where a lot of software engineer’s time is spent struggling on. It shouldn’t and definitely isn’t the only phase in the Agile cycle where software engineers are involved in, but I find a lot of software engineers along with their business counterparties stumble in these areas often. The stumbles that occur here impede the whole Agile flow, and impacts its adoption within a team and potentially organization at large. . Poorly made hypotheses . The development of the hypothesis is often estranged from the software engineers’ work and by that I mean something like the following: . Business asks for a feature &gt; Business comes up with requirements &gt; Business forks over requirements to engineers . There are two problems with this kind of “hypothesization”: . It isn’t really framed as a hypothesis. A hypothesis is about creating an assumption that is meant to be further investigated. Hence a hypothesis must always be made with the presupposition and even expectation that it may be false or incorrect. So a rewording may say that “Business thinks that a feature would be useful to be developed” instead. Dave Farley in his video covers this idea of expecting false assumptions further and better than I do | The software engineers are often the people who procure the experimentation “ingredients” (code and machineries) and make the testing of the hypothesis possible. When the those that are creating the test experiments are not involved in the development of the hypothesis, there is significant risk that what would be setup does not reflect what the hypothesis is claiming. In other words - what software engineers develop may stray away tremendously from what the business actually needs | Failure to perform tests for the hypothesis . Assuming that the software engineers have managed to scrounged up some code for the hypothesis, Agile as experimentation would say the next step is to test that the hypothesis is correct. You can also say you can (and probably should) test that the implementation of the hypothesis is correct. But too many organizations forego this step, likely because they do not think of Agile as experimentation. The result of this in my experience usually leads to (in order of severity and face-palm worthiness, with some embellishment): . Never testing it because the software never got released in fear of what can go wrong (and also not knowing what can go right) | Letting the majority of the users be the one and only tester of the hypothesis - it’s not a bug, it’s a feature (or it’s not a feature, it’s a bug) | Business performs tests on their side only at the very end when every hypothesis are realized as code. Then they spectacularly notice that nothing works as hypothesized | Software engineers never testing out their code and solution before running experiments. Usually exacerbating the length of feedback loops and by the time they are aware of issues highlighted in experiment results they already forgot what they did | Silo’d QA teams that have no idea what is happening and have poor awareness of the hypothesis that needs to be tested | The lack of testing, and the inability to perform testing whether because of technological unreadiness or organizational politics impedes the collection of data. Without this data, Agile breaks down because the next experiment cycle will be disconnected from the previous. And even if the next experiment cycle does not have anything to do with the previous one, without testing the experiment cycle is incomplete. Yet many teams and businesses readily jump in to the next experiment without really finishing the previous one at all. . It must be noted that the procurement of data and testing of the hypothesis in Agile may come from various tests and groups of testers. This idea of diverse testers should be intuitive in both its concept and also importance. In fact, the differing kinds of testers at times also help keep the experiment iteration small. For example, software engineers as testers is likely (or hopefully) testing a small piece of the hypothesis in a fairly quick manner, keeping the experiment and feedback fast and small. . Failures in adopting Agile . Now that we’ve postulated Agile as primarily an experimentation it becomes we can look at the potential concrete reasons why Agile adoption fails. And here is where the pscyhology aspect of working with or within Agile becomes more prominent. . Mischaracterization of Agile . The first thing that is quite likely to have happened is that the organization has mischaracterized Agile as a set of procedures and formal methodologies. This is exactly not what Agile was meant to be based on the Agile manifesto. The focus is likely to have been aimed at adopting Scrum or Kanban methodologies while missing the essence of Agile; an abstraction for scientific experimentation for the business problems. . Closing off from being wrong . If you watched Dave Farley’s video that I linked above you should understand where I am coming from with this. Experimentation necessitates that there is an uncertainty that wants to be further investigated. By nature this must mean that incorrect hypothesis and even seemingly unfruitful effort will be made as business attempt to solve problems through products, services and processes. . The idea of being wrong is psychologically difficult to reconciliate with. There is also a social dimension to it which hits some people harder than others, for legitimate and illegitimate reason. But even disregarding that, our brain and ego often limits our ability to accept mistakes, by others or ourselves. . Inability to change . The scientific method is a continuous loop. Each loop may feed in new data points and observations for the next loop. Iteration is enabled by the successive feed of data from one step to another. But some experiments will inevitably challenge our assumptions and hence our cycle. More likely though, challenges will come from external sources Agile processes. It is unlikely that your Agile journey will be a sequence of smooth loops; they say the only constant is change. . Disregarding turbulent external change, Agile itself promotes change, and so it must be something that teams and organizations can work and be comfortable with. But inherently change is difficult to do. There is technical aspect of change which is difficult in itself which covers aspects of software design, architecture, CI/CD and many more. Then there is the fragility of our human cognition in accepting change. . The need for change may be brought by previously held incorrect hypothesis or experimentations. And we’ve said that accepting being wrong in itself is already hard. Even if it isn’t necessitated by previous missteps we may be prone to a status quo bias. Or perhaps we have a sunk cost fallacy towards our previous assumptions. Erroneously, some organizations may situate themselves to be unable to respond to the need for change because of an end-of-history illusion . Uncontrolled change . Some organizations do change, to the point of being overwhelmed by change. Change is difficult, and more so when change happens frequently and in an unstructured fashion. The COVID-19 pandemic has thought us that we need to change our long-held practices. But the deluge, abrupt and perhaps unprecedented scale of change that needs to be adapted for the modern era made many of us grind to a halt. . Here are some examples of our difficulty when change is uncontrolled: . Small businesses anguish at ever changing regulations and response turbulence | Health officials saying they are doing science by looking and listening to the evidence that is constantly changing based on new data points. To many it seems these officials are flip-flopping and changing their stance or suggestions. | . Scrum, Kanban and other Agile methodologies particularly shine here by bringing in a framework that acts as a guidance. In particular the emphasis on the dissection of experiments into smaller pieces helps to make change feel and be manageable. But these methodologies work best when the change being brought are iterative towards some form of north star, a loose trajectory guidance. When the north star itself is what keeps changing, many will find it difficult to handle what often becomes uncontrolled change. . Industrial friction . Assuming that individuals within the organization themselves can apply Agile as a way of experimentation, there are still industrial challenges to the adoption of Agile. Such challenges may come internally or externally. . Internally, the problems mentioned above can equally be replicated and exacerbated on the organizational level. So there are the pscyhological dimensions on the individual and corporate that needs to be addressed in the adoption of Agile. Many organizations are still not comfortable yet in performing experiments; in hypothesizing, testing, analyzing data and rinse and repeat. They view business problems as work that needs to be steamrolled in one go. . Externally, some organizations are situated within an industry that makes experimentation difficult. These industries often have low tolerance for mistakes. Arguably all industries are intolerant for mistakes, but some just feel more daunting than others, whether that is true or not is another topic. . Despite internal or external friction, it is possible to adopt Agile methodologies in gradients. While indeed Agile can be adopted within the context of “move fast and break things”, it can also be adapted in more nuanced and smaller scale. I take inspiration from SpaceX that continuously runs launch experiments against their hypothetical products. The level of funding needed to run these experiments, which may end with million-dollars fireworks, is ludicrously high. Yet, SpaceX shows that it is possible that Agile is possible even in high-stake. . So instead of fully backing off from Agile, we can try to see at which parts of our organizations do Agile make sense and in what form. At the very least I think all software engineering teams can and should adopt Agile by adopting CI/CD pipelines. . NOTE: Dave Farley has a video more on SpaceX. . Final comments . When I hear Agile, I always think of the Agile Manifesto. We know that at the heart of it Agile is not Scrum, and it is not Kanban. I posit it as the abstraction of the scientific experimentation to solve business problems. . Seeing Agile as experimentation puts a lot of emphasis on Working software and Responding to change of the Manifesto. In particular, the Agile experiments are there to serve as a way to create software that works (for customers, not just for computers) according to battle-tested hypotheses. The experimental loop fundamentally necessitates organizations to expect change from the Agile cycles, and also from external forces. . Hopefully this helps you in truly bringing Agile changes to your organization. .",

            "title": "EUPHORIA - An acronym for financial well-being",
            "content": "It has been a while since my latest blog post and this time I’m writing out of whimsical inspiration. I was browsing the PersonalFinanceCanada sub-Reddit and saw a question about being mindful of lifestyle creep. If you don’t know what lifestyle creep is, it basically means ever increasingly extravagant lifestyle, usually marked with fancier material posessions, dinners or experiences. It usually coincides with increases in salary, relocation or a momentous life event (such as a financial windfall). . Usually (though not everyone necessarily sees this way), lifestyle creep has a negative connotation, particularly because it usually hampers someone’s ability to save for their future. Suffice to say that the poster of the thread was of that mindset. So I came up with the acronym EUPHORIA, hoping that it can be of help to the poster. And I hope an expansion of the acronym in this blog post will also help you. . E - Envision where you want to be . Hal Hershfield, a UCLA researcher in the domain of behavioural decision making has conducted studies into the effectiveness of envisioning yourself into the future. He contends that interestingly, often we treat ourselves in the future as completely different people. . While at first it may be surprising, intuitively you can kind of see why that may be the case. It is unsurprising to us now that though the world is ever more connected through the Internet, the lack of physical proximity may still cause a toll in our connection and relationship with others. Similarly ourselves in the future are temporally distant to ourselves. But at the very least space is arguably a visible and felt concept while time is more nebulous and seemingly unfelt, and you certainly never feel like slamming against time as you do against a wall. Compound this with the idea of trying to project yourself into the future several years ahead and you would likely have a hard time accurately depicting what you will be like into the future. . I don’t know about you, but I certainly have moments of surprises when I think back what I was like 5 years ago compared to how I am now. I find it surprising not because of how extraordinarily different I am now than what I hope to be, but simply because I didn’t even imagine a world where I am like I am now. In his research Hal and his colleagues identified that given effective cues to both visually and imaginatively one’s future self, those that were studied were able to make better savings decisions. They contend that the exercise helped create a connection between the present and future selves which helped participants to discount future rewards less. In other words they were better able to appreciate the value of delayed gratification. . U - Understand yourself . If self envisioning can help you to more seriously aim for desired future targets to achieve, then the next question would be to ask what kind of targets you would like to pursue. While you can try to envision what, how and where you want to be in the future, it is still notoriously difficult to understand the why of the goals you are making. In a previous blog post I talked a bit on the topic of exploring what matters for yourself. In the post I advocate for the notion of focusing on your situation to find out what is important for you. The blog post was inspired by the larger notion of self-understanding. . Consider the following quote: . The hardest but most important financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving - Morgan Housel . Why is it so hard? Morgan argues that in order to keep the goalpost from moving requires a sense of having enough. But our sense of needs and wants live in a continuum scale, and probability will tell you that identifying the chances of a single point in the scale to materialize is a flat zero . But a perfect understanding of what is enough for us need not be the case. We simply need to be able to narrow it down enough to a small band of area in the needs and wants spectrum such that we can confidently say that anywhere within this small band we are content and can continue to be so. To be able narrow the ban BUT also stay confident in our judgement of what brings us contentment, joy, happiness, fulfillment etc. the ability to understand ourself is needed. . Here’s an example: for myself I am keeping a “decision log” that tracks my investment decisions. It helps me record and assess my actions such that I don’t just understand myself by how I feel, but also by what I actually did. . P - Prioritize what is important, not what is nice . Now if you are able to both envision yourself, and continuously improve your understanding of yourself, you will now come to the impasse of how to proceed with life such that you can reach that envisioned content self. Between now and the future we all notice that there is no magical time leap machine we can take such that we can jump through the hoops of process and life. So we must take things step by step, which requires us to create prioritizations in life. . Fundamentally the act of prioritization is akin to the act of making decisions. For this I will direct you to this Rational Reminder podcast episode #120 with Annie Duke. . What I want to say though is that it is okay if you find your prioritizations to shift and change over time. Independently, envisioning and understanding yourself is already difficult, even more so when you start thinking of things and steps you would like to prioritize in order to achieve your goals and targets. The point is to be able to commit to the things that you have identified to be important, and if you realize eventually that they are not as important as you think they were, your vision for the future and the understanding you have for yourself will act as your lighthouse. . Many of us have heard of tales of regret from those whose lives have run out short. The least we want to be is be that someone that poured our resources for that extra dash of glittering junk in life, while missing the real beauty. . H - Hold off from making hasty decision . You may have heard of the tale of the GameStop mania in early 2021. Basically the story goes that GameStop’s stock experienced a massive increase in price, over a whopping 2000% growth from January 1st, 2021 of the year to its highest point on January 27th, 2021. Many people took a substantial amount of profit from this and those are the headlines you would like to see (or maybe not if you are feeling sour about it), but how many people LOST money? . I don’t know the global number, but here I’ll take a sample (and for sure a biased one to make a point). Based on Wealthsimple’s report 67% of people that invested in the GameStop stock (GME) lost money. The holding period is an average of 4.5 days, not very long. So what does this say? Well, in general the average investor likely saw the craze, for whatever reason decided to jump in to the craze, and then seemingly as fast as they went in they got out of it. It’s good that many didn’t lose more than 1000, but financially it would’ve been better that they didn’t lose any. Ah but perhaps they were allured at the potential prospect . Meanwhile one of the earliest believers in the GME stock, Keith Gill, made millions out of this episode (and have not fully cashed out at the time of this writing), but he was holding the stock for a much longer period than 4.5 days. He held the stock since September 2019, whilst during that time the GME stock kept going lower AND he was making YouTube content talking about his position, making his thoughts and opinions public. . Against all odds AND viewing eyes, Keith held on and continued to have conviction. Yes his conviction may have turned out to be a bad result, but you cannot deny his conviction. At least in contrast to some of his peers with a holding period of 4.5 days, his decision definitely seems less hasty. . Now it is not necessarily the time horizon that I want to focus on, but the reasoning and believe you have over your decisions that I want to highlight. Remember, your future self and your self-understanding continues to be your lighthouse. Here’s another way to get my message across: . Courtesy of imgflip O - Organize your finances and be on top of it . What you do not measure, you do not know . This is probably a pretty common saying you may have heard somewhere in your professional career or even the Internet. Leaving a side the origins of the statement and how accurate it is, it is undeniable that observability, data and understanding over that data is becoming more important in the digital age. Data is the new gold they say. So why not bring to your personal finance life? . I am an advocator for budgeting. I am not a budgeting expert, but I try to budget and set myself expenditure targets. It helps me understand where my money is going, where I want it to go, and any discrepancy between reality and desire that may happen. . For a more universal topic, mayhaps you have heard tales of people who get swamped in their purchasing debt and are having trouble keeping a rein on it or improving the situation. And if you are Canadian you probably have heard of hearsay speak about how high personal debt is in Canada(and continue to grow). . While there are possibly some structural issues that people may be facing, it can also be useful to bring in specialized financial organization tools. Coupled with a vision for your future self, an understanding of oneself, commitment to prioritization and identification of what is important and holding off from making hasty decisions, these organization tools can be immensely powerful in paving the way for financial wellness. . Here are some tools that you can try to look into: . Wealthica | Mint.com | Zero based budgeting | YNAB | Good old Excel spreadsheets | . R - Run from comparison . Here’s another commonly heard phrase: . Comparison is the thief of joy . When I was small, from time to time I get compared by my parents to some other kid they knew. Luckily it wasn’t often for me, but when it did happen it always felt unnerving and discomforting. Even for the pettiest of things (at least in my head), such as who dresses nicer (definitely not me), it would still be a bit of a sting. A sting to my pride, confidence and yes, joy. . I do not dislike all kinds of comparisons. In fact, it is useful to be able to compare one thing over another, a lot of our decisions are a matter of extracting conclusions from comparisons. But there are certainly good AND bad comparisons. Remember how apples aren’t necessarily comparable to oranges? The same case applies often when we are compared against one another. A person’s situation may seem similar but contain vastly differing details. A comparison that does not really apply equal criteria and assumptions likewise is not a good comparison. . And when it comes to finances, it is also equally important to NOT make comparisons against others yourself. Here’s an article that mentions that social and wealth comparisons are detrimental for your psyche, and there are other research delving into the topic. It is the case irrespective of who is initiating the comparison. . I think in recent years we have started to learn the lesson from our exposure to social media, and we can apply the same wisdom there with our financial lives. Some people may be able to tolerate it, some may even revel in it. But it is probably best for most if not all of us, to run from it. . I - Involve your partner in the discussion . Did you know that marriage is costly? Here’s an article from WeddingWire that says the average Canadian wedding costs 29,450 CAD (maybe it has gone down during the pandemic though). But I contend that divorce is costlier. You get the mental and physical stress, arguments, fear, trauma, child care disputes, legal costs and also on top of it the financial costs. . This is not going to be a fair example for daily people like you and me but consider Jeff and Mackenzie Bezos’ divorce. Depending on how you see it, Mackenzie (Jeff) got (lost) 38 billion USD in Amazon stock. Financially a big win for Mackenzie, but at the very least a dent into Jeff’s financial situation. As I’ve noted this is not a fair nor representative example of the average person, but it strikes an example of how costly financially a divorce can be. As your marriage (or even just dating) there are some assets that have been grown together between the you and your partner, a big one would be housing usually, which would somehow need to be divided amongst the both of you. . Here is an article that may be closer to home for young Canadian couples. It seems that financial communication has improved for these couples, yet still there are a significant percentage feeling like they are struggling to meet their financial goals. Communication is on aspect, but when I say “involve your partner” I mean so much more. It is about bringing your partner along with your journey of self-envisioning, self-understanding, self prioritization etc. Transforming the self into a process and activity of togetherness. . Let me try to inspire you with my own experience. Compared to me my partner isn’t at all interested in investments. I don’t try to force her into it but I explain to her about the things I do, and likewise she explains to me her thought process. While not much, but I managed to help her started with investing bit by bit, with what we think is suitable for her at this time. Everytime I think something good can be done for her investments I consult her, and I let her have the final say. Sometimes I want to do things faster, but she doesn’t. Sometimes I share investment material and discuss financial topics or scenarios with her, as much as she is willing to take. In doing all this I’ve made it clear to her that I want her to be financially ready and successful, regardless if I am there in her life or not. While we may be different in many ways, this is a common goal and journey that we are both working towards for each other. . A - Automate where possible . As a software engineer, automation naturally plays a big role in my life. I love to be able to automate the rote work I need to do day to day. Not only is it faster, if done well it can help bring a much needed simplicity to my activities. And the same case applies to finances, if not even more so. . Money has been a very emotionally related and charged topic in our culture. It has led to one of the greatest stressors in people’s lives. Let alone making investments, people sometimes don’t know what to do to keep things afloat! Automation can’t help to start to fill all the holes caused by financial stress, but I believe it can greatly help people achieve consistency in implementing their goals and targets. . Technology such as Scotiabank’s Bank The Rest Program, automatic paycheck deposit to savings account, pre-authorized contributions for investments, robo-advisors, spending tracking apps and tax software management, are just some examples of ways you can automate your financial life. . Will automation bring you the most optimal financial result? Theoretically, not always, especially since some of these automation technologies have a cost. However it definitely does help alleviate the taxing mental energy you would have otherwise required to invest in. And as human beings we are neither fully rational or have infinite capacity and resources to always consistently reach the optimal result. Worse, we are prone to be overconfident in our own ability. . So why not let technology help you achieve speed, greater peace of mind and consistency? Those non-financial gains may very well outweigh whatever financial optimization you were trying to do, especially when you take into account what you should prioritize . Final words . The acronym EUPHORIA was created in the mindset and context of financial well-being. But I think it has room to be amended for other contexts. Additionally it doesn’t go through the gritty details and leaves out other important considerations. Some points may need to be adapted for your specific case (most easily visible in “I” if you don’t have a partner). But in general I believe it is a good and applicable recipe for financial (or other) well-being. . If you’ve been reading this far in, thank you for your time. .",

            "title": "What Matters, Given You",
            "content": "Happy new year 2021! I hope you, the reader, had the opportunity to take the time to unwind at the end of the year and embrace the new year to come. Usually at this time people would establish some kind of new year resolution (though I don’t usually do it myself). But after coming from such a turbulent year, at the very least for the majority of people, you might not be up for creating a new year resolution. Or perhaps you may be in a situation where your life and your surroundings is in such dissonance that you can’t make heads or tails of your life, let alone a new resolution. . If we were to be honest, the transition between the past year to the new year is simply a second difference. Within one second there isn’t much that necessarily change. Rather than a new year, shouldn’t it instead be called a continuing year? Well either way, the point is that things don’t just rapidly change in a split second. Considering the situation with COVID-19, though there are hopeful sentiments on vaccine rollout, there is a real chance that the next few months in the year would feel very similar to last year. Yet, things continuously change, especially in the macro levels of our life and surroundings. In the sea of changes (and undoubtedly uncertainty), it gets difficult to pinpoint any kind of target we can aim for. In this blog post I would like to talk about a framework to help you think about meaningful targets in your life. . A digression to probability . When working with probabilities you may have come across these set of symbols: P(X|Y) (or some variant of it). In more plain English it reads out as the probability of X happening given that event Y happened. For example, we can ask what is the probability that the cake I am baking is going to turn out well (X) given that I have followed the recipe to a tee (Y), compared to simply asking what is the probability that the cake is going to turn out well (P(X) only). . Mathemathically, the calculation for P(X) and P(X|Y) are vastly different and while there are more variables involved in the latter it can actually be easier to answer the latter than the former. Why is that so? Under the conditional probability you would be assuming that some event Y has happened, constraining a part of the myriad possibilities of events that can occur to a single possibility. Meanwhile when you try to answer P(X) you have to take into account those other possibilities AND also the possibilities of Y. . But how does this relate to me you ask? . Let’s replace P with matters?, X with something and Y with you. From P(X|Y) we get matters?(something|you), which now says does this something matter given you. . Conditional situation, unconditional you . Behavioural economist Richard Thaler has said in his works that People are not dumb. The world is hard. I think we do tend to agree that yes the world can be hard and that we don’t want to be called dumb. More so than us being dumb, it certainly does feel like the world can be tremendously difficult to cope with, example: COVID-19. In a world where change is constant, it can get dizzyingly confusing and erratic to make sense of anything, let alone goals and targets. . In my recent post about budgeting I talked a bit identifying goals that are important for you. Part of the steps required to identify the important goals in your life would be to ask yourself whether those goals matter. Of course, the question of what matters to you does not stop at goals either. But the world’s hard, we’ve agreed on that, and there are so many competing viewpoints and opinions out there. And I haven’t even mentioned social media, you know that place where you can easily fall in the trap of comparisons against people you don’t even know across the whole world. Against all these variables, how do you come to decide what matters to you? . Let’s go back to the transformed symbols I mentioned before, matters?(something|you). Reading it in plain English we have “does this thing matter, given you”. Just like how calculating conditional probability let us assume certain variables, let’s start by constraining from the one variable that stays relatively well known - you. Yes you. Wouldn’t it be easier to think about the things that matter when we only consider it from our personal perspective, history, experience, knowledge, plans, past, situation etc. I’m not saying that it would be easy (look at all those parts about you I just quickly mentioned!), but it does seem easier to do. . While the world may move and change and be dizzyingly bizarre, the you that lives life second by second is likely to be majorly similar from each moment to moment, just like how the previous year transitions to the new year in a single second. Unconditionally you will remain similar to from before, and that non-conditionality I think will greatly help you to consider what truly matters for you. So my suggestion is to start thinking in the form of matters?(something|you) instead of matters?(something) . I call this the what matters, given you framework of thinking . Focusing on the simplicity . There’s a reason why I used conditional probability as my analogy. I want to emphasize on the words given you, which is intentionally used as a replacement for for you. The world’s complex, difficult, dynamic, rich and filled with other beings (human or otherwise). Obviously, the things that truly matter in the world and life are not just things that are related to you. In fact, some of those things that matter may be in complete contrast to what you may consider as important. But that’s why I framed the framework as I did. . I thought of the framework as a way to simplify the process of understanding what truly matters in life. I propose that we can start thinking about the things that matter in our life by identifying the thing that we are most likely to know best and least varied, ourselves. In truth, there will and should be further variables taken into account, but those are for the next steps. The things that matter will not just be decided by you, but it would definitely involve you. It is not ourselves that is the focus, but we can use ourselves as a starting point . Closing thoughts . Recently I have been thinking a lot about my own goals in life, which led me to ask several times the things that matter in my life. I realize, even more so than any previous time of my life, that such an endeavour is incredibly difficult. It also doesn’t help that society and our culture imposes certain expectations, overt or otherwise, on us. But in an effort to regain some sense of control over my thoughts and opinions, I have started to try tackling these large and grand questions in more simple building blocks. The framework of what matters, given you is one of them that I have recently identified. . Thank you for having read this blog post, I hope it has served useful for you. Happy new year. .",

            "title": "Budgeting in Life",
            "content": "This year I’ve taken up more interest in personal finance, and starting to really think about longer term goals (5 to 10 years ahead for example) and thinking about the costs those goals would entail. As I look more into discovering my goals and how money interplays with it I’ve taken up budgeting much more seriously, and to some people’s surprise deriving joy out of it. I honestly think the few things that I’ve come to realize and went through is of such importance to me now that I truly believe it would hold importance for a great number of people too. So in this blog post I would like to talk about budgeting, and my thinking behind it . What is a budget? . If you were to search for “what is a budget?” on Google you would get a number of definitions covering a range of ideas but they largely ring the same ideas: financial planning, income and expense estimation, planning to spend your money etc. My personal take is that budgeting is specifically the art and process of allocating resources towards a goal. In general the resources you can allocate through a budget can be anything, from something as concret as material resources to more abstract concepts such as time. . Notice how I did not add in an element of time to my description of a budget and this is deliberate. While budgeting is often cited as a way to manage money (and in general resources) in the future, in actual fact the act of managing future money requires management of money in the now. Additionally, the now is intricately linked to events and actions in the past. The baseline process can be visualized as the following: . Identify the goal in the future | Plan the required resources for the goal | Identify the gaps, if any, between required and present situation. Start to act or plan to act based identified gaps | If actions can’t be taken, reflect on why and how it became to be so | Re-adjust future goal or consider to allocate further resources to achieve the goal | It is a cyclical and continuous process of estimation, towards the future, and reflection, of the past implemented in the present. As the needs and circumstances are identified it becomes more manageable to start implementing and taking the appropriate actions to realize the desired goal. Sometimes of course you may need to re-adjust the goals. . The purpose of allocation . The allocation of resources is simply one smaller part of budgeting, while the goal of budgeting is an even larger aspect. Without the goal, the allocation of resources would be meaningless. However, rather than focus on what the goal is, I would like to focus on how the goal is established. I think it is extremely important to start from your values when creating goals. Aligning your goals to your values, the things that you care deep down in your heart and mind, I think is extremely important. Not all goals should be of equal value to you. . For example, most people’s goal I would reckon is to grow up the career ladder which might not necessarily align with one’s values. Even though going up the career ladder may bring you greater income, something I’m sure many people will be happy to have, it may mean it comes with higher amounts of responsibility which leads to less family time. If family time is something of value to you, I would definitely say it would be prudent to reassess your goal. Is it something that you really want? It is a tremendous shame to see someone reach the goal that they have set, only to realize that the goal that they made for themselves were never the right destination to head towards. . Not all goals should be of equal importance to you . Starting yourself with the question: “what is of value to me?” I believe will help you start with the right direction. Like a compass that helps ascertain the direction one is facing, your values will do the same for your goals. Once the direction is established, the range of destinations to get to will be clearer, and a clearer destination helps you to draw out the path to take. . The freedom of a budget . One of my friend dislikes budgeting, particularly with regards to budgeting as a personal financial practice. Their reason is that budgeting feels stifling, they dislikes the fact that when you financially budget you put restraints on what and how much you can spend. I think this line of thinking is not uncommon. But I would like to persuade whoever thinks so. Remember that in how I define budgeting I specifically use the word allocation and goal. The allocation of resources towards the accomplishment of a goal is not a restriction, on the contrary it is a deliberate conscious permission made by you so that you can put certain resources towards the goal. When you think of it this way, budgeting becomes the anti-thesis of a tool of restriction and instead it is a tool of freedom. . Let me give a simple example. One of my goals is simply that I would like to be entertained a.k.a I don’t want to be bored. I identified that the kinds of entertainment that I like requires paying a certain price. I ask myself - “well me, how much do I want to be entertained?” of which I answer with “I think $50 of this kind of entertainment should keep me reasonably entertained and I know that I am able to”. So I set up a financial budget of $50 per month for entertainment. Now, every month I am free to use that allocated $50 budget for my entertainment purposes however I want. When I do so, I don’t need to feel guilty or bad or worried or panic or anything that you might associate spending money frivolously with - because I have allowed myself to spend that much. If I do feel guilty, for whatever reason, that should be a signal that the budget that I have set was not appropriate for my values, which in turn is not appropriate for my goal. . I understand that by allocating only $50 in my example above a restriction is in place, set by myself, that I shouldn’t use more than $50 in a single month. Still, this restriction is one that I was freely able to make after considering my goals and values along with my current situation. The explicit process of identifying my goals and values and my current situation frees me up to make a conscious and informed decision that aligns both with the present situation and the future. Moreover, now you have freed up the rest of your resources for other goals that you want to strive for. . Taking budgeting forward . This year has been quite an overhaul on my approach towards budgeting. Before this year though I have target goals, I never enacted a budget as a way to help realize those goals in actuality. Moreover, I did not consider whether how I use my resources, predominantly time and money, aligns with not only my goals but also more importantly my values. Now that I have taken budgeting more seriously and consider how its implications I don’t see myself letting it go. If you read this far, I truly thank you for your time and allowing yourself to read this blog post. I hope it was a good use of your time resource and helped you achieve your goals. .",

            "title": "Job Search In A Pandemic, Part 1",
            "content": "Recently I have just transitioned to a new job position (2 months ago from the date of this post) and the experience of the search served to be a valuable feedback for me. Now job search is not something I look forward to and doing it in a pandemic does not make me more enthusiastic. But due to personal reasons my decision to move to a new job was already set in stone pandemic or otherwise. I am sure I am not the only one that have been doing job searches during these hard times, so I feel my experience may bring some value to those that want to or still are job searching. . Background and timeline . For background I was applying software/data engineering jobs in Toronto, Canada when I was still in Vancouver, Canada. I finished my Masters program on early April and I was targeting for a job position by end of August, which is when I planned to move to Toronto. During my job search I was working as a software engineer for a company that knows about my moving plans. Due to situation I was mostly mass applying to all kinds of software engineering jobs, though my specialty and expertise lies in backend engineering. Here is my job search timeline: . Started applying for jobs mid April to early May and then stopped because of a combination of a lack of motivation, jobs that match my preferences and feeling that it was a bit too far from August. | Restarted looking for jobs early June, this continued up to the third week of August. Applied almost daily, 1 to 3 applications | By early july only a handful (around 5) of recruiters/companies have contacted me back. Phone call interviews did not go well. Decided to introspect what kind of jobs I really want and the value I can bring forth as an engineer | In late July got a phone call interview for a node.js developer position. Flunked that one, used it as an opportunity to learn | Got a phone interview for my current company in early August, and managed to get past. Interview with management a week after, used the time to read up on company further and studied several materials | Passed interview with management and recruiter was able to put me for the technical interview with the team on the next day. | Technical interview went well, but with some hiccups. Ended with an offer that I took | The rest of this blog post will be structured following the timeline I laid out above as each one has a different story to tell. Since it’s quite long I will break the blog post to two parts. Link for the second part will be added on later . Timeline #1 . In mid April I was just finishing up my masters studies. Not wanting to waste time I immediately started to look for job openings. I decided to change some of the formatting of my resume to what I think is cleaner and better aligned to my goal of finding a software engineering job. I primarily used Indeed and LinkedIn for my job search and my searches were honed in to a full time job for software/data engineering positions. I’ve never really worked on a conctractual basis so I wasn’t sure if I would like that, and with the pandemic going on I wanted to find something that would be long lasting for a sense of security. . There isn’t much that happened during this period. I immediately noticed that many job positions were looking for more of a full-stack engineer and I really wanted to focus on backend. But since I do have a bit of frontend understanding (nothing modern or advanced) I soon decided to just apply to those that demanded full-stack capabilities, and even some that are purely frontend. Surely it is better to try and apply rather than not at all (right?). Of course, simply increasing the breadth of my applications did not mean it generated any positive results. Most of the applications I made were not receiving any replies, and if they were replied it was a rejection. Some of the reasons I came up for myself: . The employers weren’t interested in my application (this is likely the case for various reasons) | I was quite open in stating that I was looking for a job starting at the soonest on August/September and perhaps it didn’t fit with the employers timeframe | Some wild theory that companies weren’t actually looking to hire but just scouting | . While I never really know the reason, it did leave me feeling a bit dejected. Nearing May, I got a phone call from the employer that I worked for during my co-op wondering if I can come to help them on their projects. I took the offer and became busy with work and left job search on the side thinking that it may be better to try and apply another time. . Timeline #2 . In May most of my time was taken up by work and just spending my off-time relaxing by picking up some Switch games that I have neglected. When June arrived I noticed that I haven’t been looking for jobs ever since I stopped. There is only 3 months left until I move to Toronto and that felt too close comfort. It’s actually a bit funny thinking back on how a month’s difference makes my perception of time availability turn 180 degrees, from “I have time” to “I don’t have time”. . Trying to improve from my previous attempts at applications I decided to look back to my resume and cover letter once more. Some of the things that I did: . I noticed some inconsistencies in formatting and some grammatical improvements to be made in my resume | I put more emphasis on the job experiences that I wanted to highlight and be proud of by reordering them and using active words | I created several copies of my resume, only differing in the job title that I wanted to present myself as depending on the application | I decided to create a standard cover letter resume | . You would think that one of the things that I would have done was to have a connection review my resume in the list above, but as you there is no mention of it. Why? The reason is simple, I was too afraid to ask it to be critiqued by another set of eyes. Honestly, I should have sought someone to critique it for me, but I was simply too scared at the thought of being shot down, getting told that what I have won’t impress anyone and overall deflating my confidence and spirit. Deep down I know I have some issues with imposter syndrome, and honestly sometimes I do believe that I am incapable. Some time in the future I would probably write another blog post about. . Timeline #3 . Job search did not go well. The number of applications that resulted into responses can be counted on one hand, while in total I probably applied to at least 50 applications (1 - 3 applications per day, at least 5 days per week). The ratio of “success”, success here simply getting a reply, is less than 1-to-10, yikes. Furthermore, I was sure not able to impress recruiters in my phone interviews. At some moments I did think that maybe it was all because of COVID19 and the job search climate. But I decided that even if that was the case, it was something that I can’t control. No matter how much I groan, my groaning would not lead to the outcome I desire, getting a job. So I further expanded my effort to improve my application process. . I challenged myself to answer the following questions: . What kind of job I really want? Does industry matter? | What responsibilities would I best be able to serve in? What technologies that I know that can benefit the company I apply to? | Answering the two questions above I decided to stop applying to frontend-heavy jobs. I would still apply to a full stack positions, but mostly those that are more backend oriented. While this is doubling down on a specific engineering area, it is really where I want to be and where I feel I can contribute best as an employee. With that in mind I reviewed my resume and cover letter once more to change how I present myself. . My most extensive work experience were with messaging/event-driven and data streaming oriented systems which coincidentally I enjoyed and was partly the reason to why I took a masters program. Therefore I made those experiences my main highlight in both my resume and cover letter. There isn’t many applications that directly mention such systems, but I wanted to put myself forward not as an all-rounder programmer that has no specialty. I wanted to be seen as someone that has a specialty but also possessing a broad range of skills. The next major experience that I highlight is designing and building REST APIs, which at least gets mentioned a lot in job postings. Lastly, I made sure to put myself as a developer that cares for quality in my cover letter by putting some emphasis on TDD and other engineering principles. . But the highlight of this timeline must be this: I started blogging and putting time for personal projects. . It is actually no coincidence that I started blogging more from beginning of July. My lack of progress in job search led me to find other avenues I can make progress in. Blogging was one of those avenues I wanted to invest myself more in, and also a relatively easy way to gain a sense of progress. For the same reason, I also started to do more programming in my own free time. While it isn’t the progress that I need, I felt it was tremendously helpful to gain a sense of momentum in life and also combating my imposter syndrome. I needed to not just feel, but know and see that I am capable of doing something I can take pride and ownership in. Had I not decided to start blog more or code on the side, I absolutely believe that it would have been much harder for me to push myself forward and continue job search. . To be continued . This blog post has gotten quite long already and I don’t want to bore you to death with my life story. So feel free to close off the tab now, I will post the next part in the future. If you managed to read up to here, honestly thank you for reading the diary entries of a man on the internet. See you in the next part. .",

            "title": "RIL - Financial Investing in the Market",
            "content": "Poor man in a stock market exchange seems to be in pain, while I am writing a blog about my own journey with less pain For the past few months I have been dipping my feet to some financial investment vehicles. I primarily invest in broad based market indices, with certain product tilts that I’ve chosen to be fit for myself. The point of this post is not to suggestany particular investment products or vehicles, but instead to share what I’ve personally learned as an individual as I continue to invest and re-think my own financial position. . Why I Invest . Before going further to what I have learnt, giving a backstory would be beneficial to see where I am coming from. Currently my main reason for investing is for retirement. Now I’m pretty far away from any thoughts of wanting to retire or close to the expected retirement age which is 65 in Canada, 39 years away from the time of this writing. So you might ask if retirement is really something that I should be considering about, so here’s my pitch to why I think its an appropriate time for me to start considering it: . Taking from Statistics Canada, the life expectancy for a male of my age is around 78. Considering that I’m living in a pretty well-off country with social and health support I’ll assume that I can almost be assured to live to the age of 60. If I do manage to get to age 60, my life expectancy would be around 80 years old (and in general my life expectancy would increase as I continue to age). Now assume that I might want to have an early retirement at age 60, which is not uncommon to do, with the expectation that I will not have any income stream during my retirement. Additionally, say I want to have a spending power of 20k every year, for the next 20 years, then that means that I need to have 400k set aside. If I manage to save 1k for every month up to the year of my retirement, I would manage to save 408k, just barely meeting the 400k threshold. But this situation oversimplifies things as I haven’t calculated emergency spending, sickness, large payments such as buying assets, mortgage, pension income, income increase (or decrease) and many more. Suffice to say however, this quick calculation shows that relying on income and saving habits alone may mean that I may very well be short of my retirement income goal, and may mean less than desirable retirement days. . Lessons I Learnt . Now that I’ve explained and hopefully convinced you why starting to plan for retirement as early as now is reasonable, I want to go over the lessons that I’ve learned. There are three categories: goal setting and planning, rationality and expectation, humility . Goal Setting And Planning . Initially, I approached investing as another source of income and a general way for me to get money. It is not wrong that I can get income, or at least appreciation of my capital, through investing, but over time I realized that having this generic hope of getting more money didn’t help me. It didn’t help me because I didn’t have anything in particular that I was trying to achieve, and while getting more income and money is good, I didn’t necessarily feel driven by it because I felt that I can get by with what I have without investing. It is only after I laid out what I want (the goal), and start to look at how I can achieve it (the planning), that I felt financial investing started to be more interesting and something I want to take seriously. . Goal setting and planning is not constrained to investments and financial activities of course, but financial health and planning can certainly help normalize the habit because it is often related to a familiar and quantifiable form which is money. Setting goals make, and sub-goals, makes even a long-term goal such as retirement more mentally acessible and approachable, particularly when paired with clear quantifiable metrics. It has also helped me in envisioning the time horizon of my activities (in this case my investment activities), which helps me to assess the decisions that I make and whether they are in line with what is demanded of my goal. If I know I need to save 1k every month to reach my minimum desired retirement days, then saving 500 for a month is a clear overstep of what is needed to achieve my goals. At the same time, knowing that I have a long time horizon for my goal means that I am learning to expect and include in my planning unexpected events, which helps me to further prepare in the face of such events and to develop flexible plans around such potentials. . Rationality and Expectation . One of the resources I found and have been using frequently for my financial literacy and assessment is The Rational Reminder Podcast. The channel goes over a lot of decision making and thinking processes that aim to be as rational as possible (with acknowledgement that we are emotional and social beings). This way of thinking has really shaped my understanding of financial well-being as being founded upon sound and rational decisions WITH appropriate expectations. What do I mean here by appropriate expectations? Well one simple example is packaged in the common saying . past performance is not guarantee of future performance . It’s simply a statement that the past is not a perfect indicator of the future, which in hindsight is something that is easily agreeable. The problem is that a lot of the times our decision are heavily biased towards our past experiences, sidelining the evidences in front of us of the present situation. When investing it can be easy to fall in the trap of doubling down on a well performing asset in the past, thinking that its good performance will continue unabated. Or perhaps we would think we will be able to pull out from our choice when things look sour, something extremely difficult to do correctly for the plain reason that we do not have a perfect oracle into the future, and our insight can be influenced by non-evidence based reasons. . Related to goal setting and planning, I’m continuously learning to find reasonable expectations for my investments according to my goal. Since my goal is for the long-term I am setting up my investment positions to reflect that. Keeping this in mind has helped me to deal with the volatility shocks of the market. I cannot expect that my investment will continuously be increasing in value with such a long timespan, knowing that the market IS volatile and MUST be so in order to be profitable. It would be irrational of me to think otherwise, and likewise thus irrational of me to react as if it is unexpected. . Finally, acknowledgement that there are elements out of my control in the performance of my investments is helping me to isolate the reasons for the results of my decisions. Often we think good results is an indicator of good decisions, which is not necessarily true, especially in an environment where there is little that you can do to affect the results such as the market. Therefore it has been a learning point for me to assess the quality of my decisions according to what is accessible, knowledge and affect-wise, to me. This certainly helps in moderating both my expectations and having a more appropriate reflection. . Humility . Finance is definitely not my forte. When dealing with the market there are additional elements of social expectations, economics, politics, and many more, none of which are my forte. Trying to understand basic terminologies and concepts took me hours and some late night sleeps. I enjoyed them for sure, but it’s not easy, plus I’m definitely still far from being financially literate, at least to the degree that I want. Yet I still decide to invest into the market, because I (optimistically perhaps) believe that the information that I have found and learned has come from well-meaning and knowledgeable experts and that as a whole the market will perform adequately to grow its value. Combined with lessons learnt in adopting more rational expectations, I acknowledge that I am riding on the shoulders of giants. It is a humbling feeling knowing that there is so much more for me to know, and that I shouldn’t expect results are necessarily driven by my abilities. . Finishing Words . Every lesson I’ve shared here has been eye-opening and I take them fully to heart. Though I spent the least in talking about it, the lesson of humility is likely the most important for me. I expect the lessons I’ve taken so far will be applicable in all aspects of my life and I am certainly looking forward to learn, and share, further lessons in my financial journey. .",

            "title": "RIL - Request Body Buffering With Spring's RestTemplate",
            "content": "Background . I have been using the Java Spring framework for my work for a while now. I started learning the Spring framework while building a REST API application which had to connect to other remote services through their own REST API interface. While the Spring RestTemplate is currently only in maintenance mode and expected to be deprecated completely in the future, it was the first thing that I found for making HTTP requests in the Spring framework. So I just started using it out of practicality. . Now we often want to make log HTTP requests our servers make. One way is to put log statements everywhere we needed to make HTTP calls. One of the alternatives with Spring RestTemplate is to configure a logging interceptor. This way we can configure a global (or several) RestTemplates that have configured logging capability. . public class LoggingInterceptor implements ClientHttpRequestInterceptor { static Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LoggingInterceptor.class); @Override public ClientHttpResponse intercept(HttpRequest req, byte[] reqBody, ClientHttpRequestExecution ex) throws IOException { log.debug(&quot;Request body: {}&quot;, new String(reqBody, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)); ClientHttpResponse response = ex.execute(req, reqBody); InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(response.getBody(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); String body = new BufferedReader(isr) .lines() .collect(Collectors.joining(&quot; n&quot;)); log.debug(&quot;Response body: {}&quot;, body); return response; } } . Taking from the Baeldung post above, we can see that the signature for the intercept method contains a reqBody parameter of type byte[]. This means that in order to log the outgoing request body, Spring has to serialize whatever we are sending to a byte array structure in-memory. Depending on the request body that you are sending this can cause memory issues, and perhaps even out of memory errors. Additionally it probably has performance impact to your application, even if a little. So it’s something that may need some considerations. . The problem . Now in my current project I have to relay uploaded files made by clients to another service through its API call. These files will potentially be in gigabyte size range. Still using RestTemplate I realize immediately that the application will run out of memory if I logged using the interceptor above. So I decided to create two kinds of RestTemplate, one that can is configured to log requests automatically and another that doesn’t. Additionally I used HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory.setBufferRequestBody(false) to ensure that the application will not buffer the uploaded file that needs to be relayed. . But when I was functionally testing the application I kept running to out of memory errors when uploading a 1.5 GB file and no matter what I did I could not fix it. After investigating further it turns out that I didn’t know the SpringBoot Actuator is available in the classpath. One of the things that the Actuator package provides is metric collection of outgoing HTTP clients made by RestTemplates, which is automatically provided if we build our RestTemplate through the auto-configured RestTemplateBuilder provided by SpringBoot. That is if we created our RestTemplate like the following: . @Bean public RestTemplate restTemplate(RestTemplateBuilder builder) { return builder.build(); } . then the metric collection capability is automatically configured. And of course the metric collection is done by adding an interceptor, to be precise the MetricsRestTemplateCustomizer is used. This interceptor is added to the RestTemplateBuilder I used above to build the RestTemplate, and therefore all of my requests made with the RestTemplate that wasn’t configured for logging was actually buffering the request body! No wonder I kept hitting OOM errors… . The fix . Well the fix is actually quite simple, I just built the RestTemplate without the configured RestTemplateBuilder provided and everything is fine! Well… in the end I decided to move the application to use WebClient instead. Not only it is the suggested API to use now, thus am building for a future proof application, I would still be able to log requests without having to be forced to buffer the request body. Though if I want to log the request body programmatically, I would still be required to buffer the request body, but that’s a separate issue for the future. .",

            "title": "Challenging Technology's Social Free Lunch",
            "content": "No, this blog post is not about how many software companies (and I think more and more in general) provide food budgets or cater free lunch or dinner to their workers. The free lunch I mean here is an assumed and taken for granted property that technology has. Particularly a belief in technology as inevitably driving positive social progress and change. . The belief that technology deterministically drives social progress (and implicitly social good or bad) has a name: technological determinism . I don’t think this view is held explicitly, but I do think at the corporate level there is definitely a sense that progress in technology is almost always contributing imore positively to the social good than negatively. At the very least we get that sense when we see the headlines regarding technology startups (often computer software/hardware related companies) are seen as the next greatest thing. Also how this optimism is priced in to their business valuation, and how they are marketed by the founders themselves when they pitch their companies. Some examples would be: . Clearview AI founder asserting that his company is there for better law enforcement | Beyond Meat sponsoring a study to their product’s environment impact | . Why am I thinking about this now? . When I decided to go to university to study computer science my brother asked me, “why do you want to study computer science?” Back then I did not have any background in computer science, software or programming but I was quite decent in mathematics and I only know roughly that I computer science is related to math. I’ve also been a heavy user of computer throughout my life, so studying in computer science was a bit of a whimsical choice on my part. So I could only answer with “well I think it would be great to help people through software and computers” to which my brother responded with “But why do it through software and computer?” and there was no immediate reason that pops up in my mind. . As an avid computer user, computers have been tremendously useful and beneficial throughout my life. Never have I really thought of the negative implications of computers and software (aside from my mum yelling at me for using the computer too much). As I become a software engineer I felt my optimism towards technology (software specifically) is further magnified. But we’ve seen how more recent stories, government bodies, social groups, and even the technologists themselves have become more critical towards technology’s social effect. They have started to not buy in to the social free lunch of technologies as much. . When I went to DEV’s CodeLand 2020, there was a talk titled The Cost of Data by Vaidehi Joshi (you can CTRL+F to find it). Vaidehi gave a talk about how running your code on servers will lead to the use of electricity, which is often still generated by non-renewable energy sources. She went further and talked about the clean energy initiatives by top public cloud providers namely Amazon, Google and Microsoft. When the host and Vaidehi interacted after the talk, the host said: “The world of data and the world of climate change seems so far apart”. As software engineers I feel the same way, though I am intimately related to the creation of software and technology, its impact and its relations to the world around me can often elude me. While I focus in creating a software for a particular purpose, and often for what I believe as a good cause and purpose, I do not necessarily know and understand the full scope of the impact of the technology that I have created. . This mismatch between between an intimacy with creation and intimacy with effect is really the reason why I made this blog post. For this blog post I just want to create a more explicit awareness. . Acknowledging that lunch has to be paid . The skepticism towards technology is now more felt by me than ever before. Social progress and good is not so immediate and free anymore and efforts should be taken in order for the lunch to be properly given out. As technologists that create the technology I do think that I and many others are at the unique position to consider the kind of lunch that we want. . At the same time I acknowledge that it is hard to do. Not just in mental capacity and knowledge, but also in execution. Many of us work for a company or a boss that has set upon us goals and visions that may constrain what we can do. We may not feel that we are at the right place to make these high-level decisions of social impact, which may very well affect the business. Perhaps we feel like speaking out our concerns will jeopardize our job and career. . But at the end of the day someone will need to pay for the lunch. Someone has to put effort into creating a meaningful and desired social effect. I think it would be ludicrous for our stakeholders to bear the implicit costs of the products that we make. Imagine a grocery store that asks you to pay an explicit fee for the potential health complications you may contract from the ingredients they sell! Ludicrous I’d say. While I don’t think that technologists such as me has all the answers, and definitely not going to be the only one to be involved in the process, I do think we need to be more aware of it due to our unique position. Which I hope will translate to a more active participation in the construction of the desired social affects of the technologies that we build. . In the end, there’s really no free lunch. .",

            "content": "I commissioned a good designer friend of mine for a logo for this site (including a favicon), and I want to outline why the logo looks like the way it is. . As my blog title says, this blog is a scattering of thoughts. What does that mean? It means that this blog covers a range of topics and is really a representation of the scattered thoughts and ideas in my mind. At the same time I made this blog as a way to self-improve and grow, whether it be in writing, blog creation, self-advertising (though I’m not intending to heavily promote the blog as of the time of this writing) or technical matters. . Hence I thought up of a Rubik’s cube that is disentangled and ripped apart by a growing seed. The idea is that the Rubik’s cube is a structured confinement of my thoughts in a logical form with many, but finite possibilities. By disentangling the Rubik’s cube from its structured form I hope to show the attempt to “break free” from my current self, expanding my tightly held logics, thoughts, structures and experiences. At the same time it also serves the dual purpose of the scattering of my thoughts in action. The seed is the seed of growth that enables this destructuring, and its blossom is a symbol of my growth. The animation too, while entertaining, serves a purpose. Through a cycle of being structured and destructured, I acknowledge that as I grow there will be moments where I will settle with the new me, and whenever those moments come, I would want to grow again. Hence, repeating the cycle ad infinitum. . I’m truly happy for the work that my friend managed to do. Sadly, there is no attribution link I can direct to for her right now, but I hope to add it in the future. .",

            "title": "Being An Early Mentor",
            "content": "Trust me that this picture of clouds isn&#39;t randomly put here In my career so far as a software engineer I have had 3 opportunities to be a mentor for someone that is more junior than me. Sometimes this junior-senior status is established not necessarily by the capabilities and skills but more by my length of stay in the company. This was especially true when I worked in Japan that is known heavily to promote a seniority ranking of some sorts, implicitly or explicitly. . Considering that I have only been professionally in the field for 4 years, with no previous background to software programming before my undergraduate, is something I find a bit surprising even for myself. I feel blessed to have had the opportunity so early in my career and in this blog post I go over my experiences and thoughts on my role as a mentor . The first mentee . I was asked to mentor a new colleague six months into my first professional full-time career as a software engineer. By standards of total working experience this colleague was actually more senior than me, but I just so happen to have worked in the company sooner than him. This mentee was also quite adept in his tech skills, so aside from a few pointers about the team dynamics, projects, system overview I can’t actually remember any specific piece of technical knowledge that I felt I was able to impart. Actually I remembered several times where I was surprised with what he showed me, for example a specific setup that he had for the terminal-based text editor Vim. I have no shame in saying that I actually learned some things from my mentee. . My relationship with this mentee was more akin to colleague buddies. We were both close in age and was very techno-optimistic (I’m less techno-optimistic now) and think that technological advancement is always the best. We thought that impediments to technological progress is always bad. We bonded over the frustration of not being able to use and try out more modern techniques or tools, because management would say its too risky. We would shrug them off as an evil that we needed to live with and begrudgingly dreaded whenever we had to work with parts of the system that was deemed ancient (even by the really senior members in our team). . Then, my relationship as a mentor had to end because I was scouted by another team. There is an inherent idea in my head that the success of a mentor is in how much one can impart their knowledge to the mentee and in this view I would say I had done a poor job as a mentor. But I take solace in thinking that I was a great and relatable colleague, hopefully. . The second mentee . A bit more than a year into my software engineering career I was again given the opportunity to mentor an incoming colleague. This time, my mentee was actually just freshly started work as a professional software engineer. She also came from a more research oriented background, unlike my first mentee that came from a more engineering oriented background. It was clear from the get go that as a professional she was very green in terms of software engineering standards and the practical skills. I didn’t have to teach her to code, but at times I had to assist her in trying to understand one technical choice over the other. I do not know whether I was actually being an effective mentor, but often my mentee would come to ask me for assistance for her own project. When I had time to spare I would ask how she’s doing and ask if she needs assistance. . Around this time my attitude towards code quality was also becoming more bullish. Still coming off from the assumption that technical progress is important, as important or if not exceeding at times to some business needs, I would at times be hellbent that some technical progress be included into a project. One such example would be automated testing and basic CI/CD, which we were greatly lacking back then. To the credit of my persistence, and also some heavy silences during team debates, gradually my team started to adopt some of the ideas that I kept throwing at them. It wasn’t perfect of course, and it wasn’t smooth or complete either, but it got things going. . Reflecting on my code-quality-hellbent-saga I remember some times when I tried to directly impart this knowledge to my mentee, but uneffectively. I would tell her to revise her code several times, and then may in the end revert some suggestions back. Why you may ask? Well it was because I was also trying to learn the thing that I was trying to impart to my mentee. I had the drive yes, but I was rough in the edges and was more like a bulldoze trying to make its way through instead of being more like a worker ant and learning with and encouraging my mentee. I’m sure my team had their frustrations with me too and probably felt confused at times by my behaviour too. . The third mentee . The third mentee is more recent. In terms of technical skills this mentee is somewhere in between the first and second mentee, still inexperienced overall but not a blank slate. This time I have personally grown with regards to my technical skills from my time with my first and second mentee. I’ve refined my thoughts and experience a bit more and had more time to polish it. I still hold some strong opinions regarding particular positions related to the software craft, but I think I can say that I am more flexible than before. . I also try to be more accommodating and reasonable for my mentee this time, trying to explain things a bit more slowly and showcasing more examples. However, I do find myself to sometimes be a bit impatient with my mentee. It might be because of the experience that I had accumulated so far which makes certain things seem simple and easy for me. So when my mentee is not able to keep up with me I would sometimes say to myself “why can’t he get this quickly?” . But a recent reminder that I’m not always right (and certainly not great) was when I was helping my mentee for the code design of a feature he was working on. At first my mentee suggested a very simple solution that would get the job done, but I said it would be too inflexible for future changes and prone to breaking. My mentee agreed, and tried out my solution, made some unit tests and it seemed fine, until it wasn’t when a more comprehensive integration test was conducted. Turns out I made incorrect assumptions in my solution, and my mentee’s simpler solution would not have run to the same issue as mine. To be honest it did feel bad that not only was I wrong but also I led my mentee to an incorrect solution, but am glad that overall I managed to resolve everything together with my mentee. . Rounding up my experience so far . Reflecting on my mentorship experiences so far here are some things that I have taken away: . It is important as a mentor to actually be able to impart the skills that you are mentoring in. Being close colleagues with my first mentee was good, but I could have been a much more effective mentor and support for my mentee had I had the skills to backup my position | A mentor is a teacher in knowledge, methods and also in conduct. If a mentee is to learn from a mentor, then a mentor should reflect the correct posture to learning and be open to the need for growing themselves | Related to learning, I learned and am reminded that humility is so important, because we won’t get everything right. We need to learn with humility and open to admit our mistakes | To finish things off, there is a proverbial quote I like to say that goes like this (though I’m not sure where of its origins): . Above the sky, there is another sky . There will always be someone better than you, and so there is always room for you to improve and grow, even if you are a mentor and role model for someone .",

            "title": "Re-thinking Mocks",
            "content": "These days I have mainly been using Java for my professional career (roughly I have been working with Java for a year). I also mainly have been using the Spring framework along with its additional libraries at work. One of the things that I enjoy with Spring is the dependency injection capability that it provides, primarily through the @Autowired annotation. This quick and easy way to do dependency injection is also further compounded in testing benefits as Spring also provides easy and seemless way to obtain these dependencies at test time (@Import and @ContextConfiguration to name a few) makes testing much easier. I also make a good amount of use Mockito which makes my development life much easier through mocks, and this post is about mocks and my experience and thoughts on them. . What are mocks . This question has been covered in a variety of other posts out there, one of which I found most useful to be Martin Fowler’s post. In the words of Martin Fowler himself: . Mocks use behavior verification, where we instead check to see if the order made the correct calls on the warehouse. We do this check by telling the mock what to expect during setup and asking the mock to verify itself during verification . At the heart of mocking is behaviour verification, which is the ability to assert what has happened during the execution of a test, and not just what the system under test has produced. Martin Fowler made a clear distinction and emphasis on this part which you can read up on his post. . Quick example . class ClassA { ClassB dependency; boolean shouldDoFunc; ClassA(ClassB dependency, boolean shouldDoFunc) { this.dependency = dependency; this.shouldDoFunc = shouldDoFunc; } void func() { if (this.shouldDoFunc) { this.dependency.doFunc(); } } } class ClassB { void doFunc() { // do something } } // test code below void test_func_whenShouldNotDoFunc_notCallDoFunc() { ClassB classB = mock(ClassB.class); ClassA classA = new ClassA(classB, false); classA.func(); verify(classB, never()).doFunc(); } . The above example is extremely contrived but it just barely shows the use case of mocks. The call to the verify function says that we are trying to verify that when shouldDoFunc = false, we expect that ClassB.doFunc will not be called. . The alternative to using mocks above would be to supply an actual instance of ClassB (not mocked) and check against the results after calling ClassA.func. Now in the above example no values are being returned from any of the function calls so no returned value can be expected, however often such functions causes side-effects. Common side-effects include calling some API that causes some change, changing the environment settings, performing DB changes such as updates, changing the state of ClassB and many more. Such side-effects are testable and verifiable (if there are no side-effects performed by the function I question why the function exists). . The positives of mocks . From my experience thus far using mocks is that it has been beneficial to create tests. Certain testing may require an expensive setup or verification procedure, which makes tests run slow but also developed more slowly. An alternative to mocks may include creating fakes or stubs (a separate kind of testing entity), which may also create additional development effort to make and also may require its own maintenance. Though a great deal of this benefit comes from the fact that many languages have a well-tested and prevalent mocking library. . Mocks also makes creating truly unit tests easier, and by unit here I mean tests that only put a single class/object under test. Mocks enable me to put the focus and attention of tests on the specific unit under test and not have to worry about the other interacting pieces. In the example above, the test is made deliberately about ClassA.func behaviour when it is in a certain state. In more complex objects under test, this makes some desired fine-grained testing much more approachable and manageable. . The negatives of mocks . The biggest drawback using mocking is it requires whitebox testing, in order to verify using mocks we need to know what functions are being called, which essentially bears down to knowing some level of detail about the implementation of the unit under test. Nowadays I think of this as reflection for testing. Reflection is the ability to inspect programming constructs at runtime of some code within the code itself. Often this involves passing in names of functions or fields in the form of strings to specialized reflection APIs. Since access is made via strings, IDEs won’t help you during refactoring which makes mistakes during changes in the codebase harder to detect. Thankfully a testing is one of the tools we have to safeguard ourselves against our programming mistakes, until the tests start to fail us. . Using reflection capabilities requires the programmer to have clear knowledge about what is and isn’t present and bake that knowledge statically into the code and it is the same case when we use mocks. Now libraries like Mockito does enable the use of refactoring through IDE unlike reflection, but mocking doesn’t easily allow us to change the tests when the dependency calls in the code under test changes. This creates a mismatch between expectation and reality. For example, if in ClassA above we change the call of doFunc to another function doFunc2, the test would still pass but for very much the wrong reason! The reality is that doFunc is no longer a dependency call being made, but the test still expects it as a call to be made and it just so happens the test was verifying that no calls were to be made. The following test would fail: . void test_func_whenShouldDoFunc_callDoFunc() { ClassB classB = mock(ClassB.class); ClassA classA = new ClassA(classB, true); classA.func(); verify(classB, once()).doFunc(); } . but now the test fails for the wrong reason! The test will fail because the test is expecting the wrong thing, not because the unit under test is behaving incorrectly. This is test maintenance drag. Martin Fowler calls this the coupling of implementation and testing. . An alternative for mocking . One of the compelling alternatives to mocking is by supplying functions as parameters to the unit under test instead of whole object dependencies. The ability to pass functions as parameters is called First-class function. Consider this example in pseudo-Javascript . function funcToTest(dependentFunction) { if (some condition) { dependentFunction(); } } test_funcToTest_whenConditionNotMet_doNotCallDependentFunction() { // do something to cause condition to not be met counter = 0 funcToTest(() -&gt; counter + 1) if (counter != 0) { throw new TestFailed() } } . The passed in dependentFunction is simply a function passed as a parameter that is called when some condition is met inside funcToTest. Notice how in the test we are also verifying the behaviour of funcToTest under some condition, similar to the example with ClassA. In both the test using mocks and first-class function we see that behaviour is being verified, and this should come as no surprise. We can think of objects as instances of namespaces/groupings for functions (with the ability to maintain and collect some form of internal state) and so when we pass an object as a dependency it can be seen as passing in a collection of functions. The difference is that when we use mocks we have to explicitly mention the dependent function we are interested in, while with first-class functions the dependent function is stipulated in formal syntax (scratching off the fact that it’s possible to call functions without their parameters in Javascript). With mocks tests can fail/pass for reasons of a mismatch between expectation and reality, with first-class functions that possibility is greatly diminished and if it happens is likely the programmer’s mistake. . However in reality I have not used first-class functions as an alternative to mocks at all. Much the reason is because it is much easier to work with objects and mocks in Java. Though Java does have lambda functions and the @FunctionalInterface it is not that fluid to create classes and methods that take in first-class functions all the time. But this is surely a technique that I would explore and be more conscious of in the future. .",

            "title": "Reflecting on racism and recent events",
            "content": "What is this post about? . In the tragic death of George Floyd and the still ongoing protests as of this writing, I have been thinking and reflecting on the issue of racism. While the issue and protest have been triggered within the North American cultural context, the angle of my reflection is not restricted to the NA context. Partly because racism isn’t contained within a particular culture, and also my own lack of understanding of the NA context. . Why now? . I’m the type to take my time trying to understand and grasp the subtleties of issues. Making this post is not an assertion that I have gotten all the details pinned down, on the contrary it is my attempt to just start from somewhere, in my own way. Some would say that I should have just immediately take some form of action and not be so caught up with how right or wrong what I do is. I won’t argue with that sentiment1, just that it’s not how I usually operate. . Without the tragedy that befell upon George Floyd, I likely won’t be making a post with this particular theme. Had recent events not been so widespread, I also think I probably won’t have made a post specifically on this topic either. So the creation of this post is also a result of being compelled to act due to my ignorance. . Have I been subjected to racism? . No. At least I do not feel that any of the treatments that I have received had been motivated by racism, intentional or not. Perhaps the closest event to racism would be when I was with my friend speaking our mother tongue language. Apparently at that time he overheard two people making near us to be making murmuring sounds which he said seemed to be making an impersonation of our speech. . Am I racist? . I do not think of myself as racist, but I doubt any person asked this would respond with an affirmative yes. But I realize that when talking amongst my close friends that I do make racial remarks of our own group jokingly. I also know that I have my own explicit racial presumptions. As someone with a bit of tanned color skin I did have my own phase of negatively viewing my skin color. It was brief, but it was a moment of associating human worth with skin color and an ingredient for developing racism through the lens of skin color. No one has said that I’m a racist, but that doesn’t mean that I have not been one, acted as one, or exude the sense that I am. . Am I an anti-racist? . To be honest the word anti-racist2 is a first for me from reading and hearing the various resources over these past few weeks. With regards to moral values I would say yes I am against anyone to be a target of racism. But I would not say that I have spoken up against racism, especially not compared to the recent calling to denounce racism and being anti-racist. When my friend pointed out to me the two people who he thought to be mimicking our speech I told him to let it be and to not let it bother him too much. I wasn’t sure myself whether the two people were really making a mockery of our speech or not, but at least reflecting back I should have stood up for my friend more, at least when I was consulting him and his feelings of discomfort . My stance on racism . Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image …” - Genesis 1:26 . Whether by divine or natural commonality I believe that there is no difference in the intrinsic value between people of different races, skin color, social standing and culture. Intrinsically, everyone is equally valuable and should be respected as such. But in having this stance I sometimes forget the peculiarities surrounding one’s experience, the good and also their hardships. As we live our lives and subject to our personal AND collective experience, we would pick up unique perceptions and also treatments. . Not having felt to have been a subject of racism makes me prone to the thought of dismissing certain identity roles in one’s experience, including their race. Though, having given further thought to my own experiences and experiences, I would not retract my foundational belief of the intrinsic worth of people. This is a point of growth that I would hope to continue further as I continue life and interact with others. . Thoughts on violence in recent protests . I am not one that would like to resort to violence. I can imagine myself being violent, I can imagine myself returning payback violently to others, but I can’t imagine myself actually doing it. When I saw the violent death of George Floyd, I became teary-eyed, and when I took the time to replay it over and over in video and in mind, I wept. But my tears are certainly different from the tears of the black community who have experienced such physical abuse directly. My tears flowed because it was heart-wrenching and clashed against my moral conscience, but the tears of those who are right in that situation is AT LEAST the same as mine, and more. So acknowledging that, while my ideals remain to be advocating non-violent response, I can understand the impulse and need to unleash violence by some. . Still, it is difficult for me to come to terms morally to the use of violence. In fact, at times I have difficulties to come to terms with being angry as one school drama teacher questioned my ability to be angry; “can you actually be angry for once?” Compounded with the possibility and reality3, that those who have enacted violence are not necessarily doing so with care for others, whether they be the police or protesters, it becomes harder for me to square with the violence. While violence has justified itself throughout history to play a central role in the development of humanity for better or worse, I just don’t know if this is the time for violence for the better. . To black readers . I do not know how you perceive my writing. Is it with disdain? Disagreement? Disgust? Sadness? Regardless of what you think of me, I want you to know that you matter, and that your life certainly matter. No one can say otherwise, and I hope you will always bring that sense of worth with you. . To all readers . Sometimes in dealing with others’ experience, our mind starts churning. We start to rationalize others’ experience try in the name of objectivity and critical thinking to break down experience into minute facts, of which is formed through our own understanding. In doing so, when our understanding and experience is mismatch with the reality experienced by the other, we start to question the legitimacy of their claims. As I underwent reflection for this post, countless times I have done this myself, putting myself at the seat and lens of rationality. The progress of science have put a moral (or at least goodness) pedestal for objectivity, the analytical mind, the scientist within us. . But rewinding my senses to the time when I watched the video of George Floyd’s death it wasn’t objectivity that first shock me, it was the sadness and the desire to scream STOP! towards the police officers despite seeing it though a monitor. The first thing that connected and captured us within the tragedy was not our mind, but our hearts and emotion. Yes, being analytical has its time, but we are not animals of pure rationality either, having both thoughts and feelings. As such I hope we can all learn and continue to channel our hearts and feelings for the compassion of others, as many of us would fail to understand the lived experience, but can still share our emotions with one another. .

            "title": "The best course at SFU was a Sociology course",
            "content": "For my final term at SFU for the Big Data specialization masters program I was at a decision junction between several courses I can take. I was certain of taking an NLP (natural language processing) course and only need to take one more elective course besides that. The choice was between CMPT 727 - Statistical Machine Learning and CMNS 815 - Social Construction of Communication Technologies. CMPT 727 would clearly complement the whole degree itself and would even go hand in hand with NLP, while CMNS 815 may be argued as more loosely tied to the degree and my overall career path. But I have made a similar decision before in my undergraduate years, between taking statistics or philosophy as my minor. I chose the uncommon philosophy as my choice, and in the same fate spirit as I did before I choise CMNS 815 as my last elective course to take. . Why? . My decision to take philosophy as my undergraduate minor were due to both my interest and benefits. With machine learning and data science on the rise, many would probably I missed out on the opportunity as statistical capabilities would help me transition with more ease to such roles. Personally I disagree, firstly because statistics is not something I’m particularly fond of learning (it is one of the more difficult areas of mathematics for me to get a handle on), and secondly I felt that zoning in on a technical field would make me too technically inclined. I prefer to be more balanced and rounded in both discipline and worldview. These same reasons apply when I chose CMNS 815 over CMPT 727. I knew that I am neither greatly interested in statistics or machine learning (I prefer building and designing software) and that CMNS 815 would help me see technology in a broder social context. . What I learned . CMNS 815 in a nutshell was examining how technologies not just impact, but play a role in the shaping of society, cultures and worldviews. The technologies discussed were not constraint to the technologies we are so wary of these days such as social media, surveillance cameras, computers but also to clocks, institutions, language and many more things that in this day and age we would not immediately associate with the word “technology”. Perhaps it is better to replace “technology” with the term “tools of life” to capture the broad sense of technology covered. But the course isn’t about isolating particular social phenomena or impact to a particular technology, but it attempted to use particular case studies of technology to bring about understanding and appreciation of how technology MAY impact society. Example of topics include: . distributed agency, realizing objects (technologies) can express a form of choice and greatly affect our own sense of agency | the subtle yet powerful classifications made by technologies and their designers | the encoding of humanity in something that is not human, such as data | importance and power of language and metaphors in how we think of the world including technologies | ethics and how technologists grapple with ethical needs and perceived moral stances | shaping behaviour through technology | . and many more… . Why I value it so much . Aside from my own interests the professor Sun Ha Hong who teched the course was clearly keen, knowledgeable and empathetic. Combined with my own personal interests, it made the class much more enjoyable. The small class size (7 people in total) was also beneficial as thre were a lot of opportunities, designed or ad-hoc, to engage with students and exchange pointers. Above all however is the diversity of topics, while also maintaining an approachable depth so as to not just be a skim of topics. As a professional working in software, there are seldom any encouragement or endorsed professional opportunity to expand insights beyond the usual technical realm. Having guidance in the vast discourse of social topics helps me expand my understanding and appreciation in a manageable way. . As a software engineer I wanted to be better at wrestling and engaging with the social consequences of my own work and the profession itself. I came to CMNS 815 with that hope, and I felt it did better prepare me for future challenges. Certainly, the spotlights given by media these days pressured me to thinking that I should be able to balance the ethical and social good with monetary results. But I am also of the conviction that positively navigating the social dilemmas of our creation should be a nurtured and expected ability of software engineers. This course helped me forward to realize that conviction in my own professional life. Sure, the chances of being asked about the social issues of technology in an interview will likely not crop up. Open discussion of them might not even happen reasonably often, and my colleagues may show little interest. However, I see this knowledge and experience as my little edge over others, and I can proudly say that I am not afraid to reflect on the muddy social issues of the software I had built. . As a culmination of what I had learnt I wrote a paper on cryptocurrency and trust (maybe I will cover it in some future time). . My recommendation to you . If you are an SFU student and you can afford to take this course, take this course. If you happen to find a similar course somewhere else take it. I’m obviously biased, and well aware that such my fellow software engineers (or perhaps technologists in general) are not really inclined to take such courses. I understand, between learning something that can have immediate clear gains to your professional and personal life (learning some new language) vs a course like CMNS 815, many would choose the former. Yet I can’t help to recommend this course least because of the knowledge and experience I had gained, and more so due to how I throughly enjoyed it. .",

            "content": "The first time I tried blogging was back in 2017. Like now, back then I had the same thought of “hey why not start blogging, it will be good for experience and maybe it will be helpful for people”. But then I stopped, and here I am again trying to make blog posts. One time I had an interview for a job and the interviewee asked me what do in my personal time to which I said I used to blog, which the interviewee of course asked “why did you stop?” It was a hard question to answer on the spot, because I knew that the truthful answer does not put me in a good spotlight. The reasons why I stopped blogging was… . Lazy . I was lazy. I felt the need to keep making posts and coming up with things to talk about (as if I was getting any readership, I didn’t even promote or manage my blog’s SEO). That feeling of needing to make posts in a consistent basis, if not for the views at least for self-improvement, was honestly not fun to do. And it created this feeling of pressure to do it, like a dreaded homework that you keep procastinating. . Scared . I was scared. Even though I knew I wasn’t necessarily getting any readership (I didn’t set up analytics but most probably did not), I was scared at putting my thoughts in the public domain. I was scared if the presentation was good enough, are the words I chose appropriate, is my post controversial, is it relatable etc. etc. I have a knack for overthinking and finding different possibilities, and surely I did and it kind of overwhelmed me funnily enough. . What’s different now . I only recently entertained the idea of blogging again. It’s not to kill time during the COVID-19 pandemic but because I still do have desires to express my thoughts in some concrete manner, which blogging helps with. It’s also a way for me to have my own little personal “product” that I can work on bit by bit. So there is both personal and professional reasons to why I am restarting blogging. To help overcome the reasons why I stopped blogging, here are several things I want to stick to as much as possible: . Not hoping to gain viewership. I want to make this blog grow for now for myself and I don’t want to be caught up on “advertising”, which also includes feeling forced to make posts in a consistent timeframe | Focusing on creating honest but quality written work. I want to emphasize on the honesty part first, and then worry about presentation and stringent professionalism second | Enjoy it more! Honestly, I need to enjoy my own creative work more and enjoy the process of it | I’ll be sticking my best to these guidelines .",

            "title": "Values and AI",
            "content": "Thinking, thinking, thinking, always thinking Intro . A couple of days ago I read the following article on AI and jobs . The author, Mr. Kai-Fu Lee goes back a bit telling his tale, a near death experience, continued with regret and then resolving it into a vision for the current and upcoming age of AI. In the article he argued that in order for us to co-exist (take not he didn’t say to win) with AI is for us to create avenues in life , particularly jobs that takes advantage and relies on our humanity. The specific quality which he propose to be a solution to the job-market-wrecking-AI problem is love. Mr. Lee did mention other qualities which we often think are intrinsically tied to what makes us humans, but the main thing is love. Mr. Lee’s article then made me thinking about values and AI, and I’ve thought of several things. So let’s continue and read them below! . The value of data . You may have heard by now the wise words “Knowledge is power” (to which I agree). And you may have heard “Data is the new oil”, that is data is the basis of our current age, just like oil was in the 18th century. But of course humanity has amassed knowledge and data for so many years, past decades and centuries, though they do say most of our amassed data has been created in the past few years. You get the idea though, we’ve been gathering data for many years now and now with the advancement of technology the data we have stacked up and gathered that have been left to dust previously are being picked up and consumed. We feed our computers, servers, models with data and create products and services out of them. Where previously data was just lying there seemingly dead without much use (aside for a select group of entities, like Google which really have the resources and expertise), now our world is inundated with data and so called data-driven decision. Through technology we have managed to extract and find value in data. . Extending the value of data with AI . And then there’s AI, which like Mr. Lee said, really is another piece of technology that consumes and tries to get value out of our data. But it not only extracts value out of data, AI also extrapolates value out of our data. It creates models, decisions, predictions, generalizations out of our data and use them on complex subjects it may have never seen and which we like to solve or get better at. AI enables things like self-driving cars, better more relevant ads, AlphaGo possible. To add to that, with current advances in technology and research AI has really taken off not just in complexity but also speed and availability. AI has taken the value of data a step further by enabling the ability to create services and products that really wouldn’t have been able to take off without it (think self-driving cars). Though at the same time it has made several of our jobs redundant. . Extending the value of AI? . Now that AI has given us so much value, where do we go from here on? How do we keep ourselves relevant in a world where technology and AI has been able to eke out value out of data, the resource that is believed to be most crucial in our age, better (arguably) and faster (definitely) than we ourselves can? Mr. Lee’s proposed solution is more akin to complementing that rather than extending on it. Rather than trying to come up with a way in which we can possibly do better than AI, or add something to AI’s results which it cannot do itself, to him it is better to to work alongside AI and let us be complemented and also to complement it with our inherent humanistic qualities. . The problem is… . The idea itself is fine in my opinion, but the execution may not be so simple. I’m pretty sure there are many more people who are far more qualified than me to talk about AI and how to solve the possibility of us being runover by AI. But despite the many influential and capable people out there it seems the fear and worry has not gone away and no actual implemented solution is on the way. At best it’s because the problem is inherently hard to formulate and to solve in a way that can satisfy the vast majority of our world. At worst… it’s because we really don’t know think there are significant value we can gain from our inherent humanity. . Okay I doubt it’s as bad as I purport, but I do think the thought has some merit. At the very least I do think we don’t give enough objective and appreciation to our humanistic qualities. For example, I’m sure most if not all of us would agree that a great and caring parent goes a long way in the upbringing of a child and their future. A child that is brought up well and with great care probably has less risks to incur mental health problems which may be related to their environment. So those kids in the future can be healthier, and less cost is needed to maintain his or her mental health. A great parent also seems likely to enable their child to attain greater heights, and thus higher social contribution in the future. These are all valuable things for us and our society and have direct or indirect consequence to our economy, but I’m not aware of any widespread economic measurement that takes into account quality of parenthood. . There are many other humanistic qualities which I am sure we do value in our life, but are not given it’s due appreciation and value in an objective manner. Whether that objective quantification or assessment is in terms of monetary value, or recognition, or something else, I do think we are lacking in that aspect. This is a problem that is not inherent in AI but in us, in how we see, value and think of life, of ourselves. If we are to complement the value of our AI with value inherent in us, then we must be able to value our human capabilities and existence in ourselves and in others. . Wrapping up . I think Mr. Lee’s blueprint, though barebones, is something agreeable. Rather than battling our way through data and AI’s inherent ability to qucikly and accurately derive value out of data we should strive to look into ourselves ways in which we can bring about value through our own nature. As AI achieves feats which we have previously only associated with humans we would need to branch out to other areas, whether to compete or to co-exist with AI. But branching out would also entail our desire and ability to find value in those areas, a problem which I think we, as humans and society, need to solve by ourselves and re-align our values. .",

            "title": "Balance in life",
            "content": "Around 1 year and a month ago I started working in Japan. Perhaps many of you have heard on the harsh conditions of long working hours in Japan and incidents of suicide by death and other such depressing stories. Being faced with such a possibility I put myself in a staunch position to maintain a clear distinction between personal and work life and not to let one or the other, particularly the work aspect, negatively impact on the other. And of course this is what many of us refer to as work-life balance, maintaining an equilibrium between work and personal life. But there’s more to this than simply about work-life balance. . After establishing my stance on my work-life balance, I started to think about all kinds of balance in life, having realized how important it is in general in our lives. As an example, during people’s daily work, we have a stack of to-do list everyday and sometimes I would need to find the balance between, in terms of time spent, working on task A compared to all other tasks. As another example, when we buy products many of us would weight in between the price vs value of a service or good. Yet in another example we talk about maintaining a balanced diet for our health. It would seem that balance is quite prevalent in our life. . A quick skim of balance led me to the believe that balance is important and prevalent in our life, which leads me to the question: how well are we at creating, identifying and maintaining balance? I’m asking this not so much on the perspective of human’s innate ability but more so on our surroundings. A lot of our time is spent in improving ourselves or just doing a small set of core activities, and there are advices to continue doing so. Just as an example, there’s quite a lot of advices to maintain focus in order to get into an Ivy League school, like here or here. On the other hand many of us grew up in an environment in school that exposed us to all kinds of activities by having us take a diverse set of subjects in 12 years. . Yet again at work and at other times we are asked to focus and present the main points, while in the process of focusing on the main points we are asked to consider alternatives, balancing our view points. We’re told to find and focus on the things and people that matter, at the same time we’re told by articles to travel and explore and find something new to do, to be adventurous. People want us to be nice, but at the same time we shouldn’t make ourselves exposed to danger. In showing these examples I think there is one thing that we can consider: we have a love with balance and at the same time we have a love in focus. And between our love for focus and our love for balance, we have the meta question of how do we balance between the two? . I might not have a universal answer to the question, but I do believe that a possible answer is that that each of us not only have a common sense of balance but also a personal sense. My sense of work-life balance is most likely not the same as Elon Musk, who just made another venture into a brain-computer company and still managing 3 other companies. Your sense of good to safety balance is probably not the same as mine as people have different levels of good they are comfortable in displaying. What I think is balanced may not necessarily be what you think is balanced. A lot of it really comes down to identifying and being aware of personal value and adjusting as needed. It’s more of a part of the art of living than it is the science of living. That’s my take. . There are certainly a lot of talk about focus, and a lot of talk about balance, and sometimes one will prevail over another out of necessity but there are also times we would need to balance between the two. In between the myriad of advices for such situations I just think there is little talk in reconciling the two. Having being so conscious on balancing my own life made me realize the relevance of it and how it is so intrinsic to our lives, because if you go over some of the examples I gave a lot of balancing we do is for the sake of maximizing or minimizing results, something we humans put a lot of attention into. The sense of balance you have now may not be the best it can be, but I think if only we can identify them we put ourselves in a better position to create a balanced life by simply being aware of it.

            "title": "Journey Until Now",
            "content": "Intro . Getting started with this website’s blog, I would really like to quickly go over the journey that I’ve went through until now. Since I would be sharing my opinions and thoughts quite often I hope this first post will be able to act as a context of how I came to form my thoughts. Also, I think it’s a nice way for me to reach out to you readers personally, to a certain extent. . Indonesia . Considering that Indonesia is my home country it definitely served as an important foundation in my life. Particularly my education. Before starting elementary school I went to a pre-school, that according to my mum deemed me unfit to continue to elementary school. Long story short, my parents moved me to another school out of frustration. And I’m glad to have been moved. . The school that I moved to had a complete elementary to high school education. Yes, I was in the same school for 12 years. For 12 years I was with more or less the same people, a few became quite good friends of mine. Reflecting back it was very stable times, things were very predictable, I had friends around me and support of my family. This stability and ease really enabled me to focus on my education. In this sense I was very privileged, and I agree, I was. Not to mention the school had a good International Baccalaureate program, a program that I feel emulated university life quite well. It had a good portion of projects, essays, lab reports etc. that mattered to the final decision along with a final exam. Very similar to undergraduate education these days. What I loved most learning in IB was that it didn’t settle down on a particular world view. It’s curriculum was set up with an emphasis on finding out “how” and “why” not just “what”. So the curriculum never fixated itself to a particular context but instead encouraged exploration of multiple contexts. . Speaking of focus, though I say I was able to focus in my education, as a child I was actually unable to focus. My mum enrolled me to Kumon, a math after-school program in order for me to be able to sit down, study and focus (I was a very hyperactive kid she said). Fortunately my fondness of math started from here, and though I may have liked math without Kumon I don’t think I would be so into it without it. Kumon did work and helped me focus at my tasks at hand, though perhaps unfortunately now I’m much more fond of just sitting and thinking instead of moving around doing physical exercise. You gain some, you lose some I suppose. Oh and as trivia I was known as the math whiz-kid earning myself the title “walking calculator”. It didn’t make me look cooler though, but being geeky and nerdy is also great. . Canada . First of all I have to say, my time in Canada has undoubtedly been the best time of my life. It’s the time that I really got to see the world for myself and a time of growth. I enjoyed the diversity of Canada, it’s friendly people and it’s tendency to be open-minded and welcoming. Though I didn’t really enjoy the winter-ish spring, teenage-angst weather, goose spawns, oh and less than subpar public transport (sorry have been pampered by Japan’s public transport here). But hey, again, you lose some you gain some. . As a recap I went to Canada to pursue my computer science degree. And you may wonder why Canada and the answer is quite simple, because my elder brother and sister both went to Canada for their undergraduate studies. Actually they went at a much earlier age and they started school in Canada ever since their high school, and at that time I was 7 years old. My brother and sister going to Canada when I was at such a young age also allowed me to develop in peculiar ways, but I will save it perhaps for another time. But yes, essentially my parents had a sense of familiarity with Canada so we chose Canada. As for why not Indonesia, it was primarily because the IB program was aimed for international education and it would have been a shame I thought to settle down in Indonesia and not try to cultivate that international mindset elsewhere. . But wait, you might now be thinking why computer science? And for that question… to this date I still don’t know exactly why. I remember very clearly there was a day that my brother asked me “so why are you choosing computer science?” to which I gave the trite answer “I feel like I can help change the world with it”. Not very original, and wasn’t very sure either back then. Though I do like math and computer science is a part of mathematics I’ve never had any exposure to it. The best that I know was something along the lines “it involves programming”. And I was right, but it was certainly much more than that. . My first term in university I thought to myself “maybe I chose the wrong major…”. Computer science was difficult, it was by far the most difficult subject/field I have ever studied. And it was most likely a combination of first time living alone and first time faced with such a difficult subject that made me question my decision. It was not as if I was getting bad marks, but for every single assignment I would take at least 10 hours to complete it, and in the end my grades were just “fine”. It was that shocked feeling I suppose of not being able to achieve my usual standard despite great efforts that really threw me off. Nevertheless it was a much needed experience since then I understood how much more there is for me to work on and managing my ego. I’m certainly glad to have stuck with computer science since now I absolutely love it, and really encourage others to give it a try. . There was one thing that I definitely regret while I was in Canada and that is not being able to take University of Waterloo’s famous co-op program. I actually applied for it but was not accepted. And I tried applying for it in my second term, which was the last term a currently enrolled student can try applying for co-op, and again I failed. I regret it mostly because I didn’t get a Canadian working experience and co-op would have helped me immensely with that. I would have most likely stayed in Canada or try for US if I had. On the flip side it enabled me to really focus on my studies. In the end I chose to sprint through university thinking that the faster I finish university, the faster I can start working. In addition, since many people were taking co-op which prolongs the time it takes to finish their studies, most of my classmetes were older than me, giving me a chance to connect with a variety of people. Again give and take, and if I were to be given a chance to redo it all over again… I would still choose to try for coop HAHAHA, but all in all things worked out for me. . Japan . Now I’m in Japan and lo and behold, the reason why I am now in Japan is not very different from why I was in Canada: by chance I am now here. Summer 2015 was supposed to be my last term in university, I was one term away from completing a total of eight terms. At that time I’ve only taken one long term break during winter 2014 when I interned in a digital marketing agency. I was a bit proud of it, I thought I could finish the whole of university with only one term break under my belt, I guess just from a sense of feeling I worked hard. However my brother was going to get married in August 2015, right around exam season and so I decided it was best to postpone my final term. It was at this time that I applied for my current job. . To be honest I didn’t know at all about Rakuten, Inc. By chance I saw a post from UW’s computer science facebook group information about company in Japan was hiring and so I applied considering I had the time to. Somehow or another I was accepted. I say “somehow” because really I didn’t even expect to get an interview considering how poorly I thought I performed in the initial coding test. . I had no experience in Japan and moving would be (and is) a very challenging shift for me. Though precisely because of that I took the offer, for the prospect of personal growth and career growth thinking and hoping that the experience would enable me to shape a brighter path up ahead. I would most likely post about my time and impressions in Japan at another time, but so far it has been turning out quite well with some less-than-ideal moments, to be expected. . And now here I am… . Settling down a bit going through the motions of day to day life, living out a life this time as a part of the workforce, as a foreigner and that guy that smiles randomly in the streets. I hope this post was able to give you some insight to what kind of person I may be, whatever it is. Going forward may this post serve as a reminder of the context of upbringing, education life, personal interactions and such that I have went through so that my blog posts are more easily digested in mind and heart. . I do want to go somewhere else, Japan in my mind is not the place I would want to settle in, I just don’t know where yet. Most likely candidate right now would be to go back to Canada, catch up with friends, and finally get that Canadian experience. But things are still up in the air and plus by the time of this writing it has only been a year or so I’m in Japan. Perhaps the next place I go to will be another ‘by chance’ moment, I think my life is filled with a lot of those by now. Wherever I’m going I hope you can join me in the journey. .",
