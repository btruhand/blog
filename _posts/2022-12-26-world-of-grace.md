First of all, Merry Christmas 2022 everyone! I hope you were able to spend time with your loved ones, or at least had the chance to take some reprieve from the busyness and frantic schedule that 2022 has imposed. In spirit of christmas I wanted to make this post, and excuse me ahead of time for a post that may seem to be a bit Christian centric. But I assure you this post is short and quick (no time return though, unlike gift shopping :sweat_smile:)

Googling `grace`, one of the definitions you get will be:

> (in Christian belief) the free and unmerited favor of God, as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings.

Now this post won't be talking about this specific definition of grace, but it's definitely influenced. I want to talk about the grace of humans, in particular the grace that a human may display to one another (or in extension towards non-human entities). Now in Christian teachings, grace given by God for the redemption of humanity from their sin in past, present, and future. Clearly not something that is within the realms of humans. So instead here's the definition of grace that I will use:

> a deliberate decision to not enforce one's power over another party that will cause harm or pain or with no regard for the best of the other party

A bit lengthy, and you may think that this definition falls under "do no harm"/"do no evil". Part of it is, but it goes beyond. Some examples may help:

1. not delivering judgement (behind/in front of them), despite moral high ground
2. not increasing prices when you have market dominance (similarly, not using a tight labour market to demand higher pay)
3. dropping our rights to make a claim in court towards anotheer who you feel have wronged you
4. embracing those deemed, implicitly or explicitly, not desirable in your group
5. not seeking tit-for-tat
6. delivering the best for others
7. make our resources for the benefits of others

Grace is my mind is not simply to not do something, but it is the active disposition to do the best, and give the best for other parties. To forego the power and dominion we have for ourselves, and instead to give it for others, often at the expense of ourselves. It's the dissolution of the concept of claiming what we own and owed at every turn in our lives.

Can a world where everyone show grace towards everyone (not just your select chosen few like your friends/family) exist? What would such a world like? I naturally think that such a world will be open to unscrupulous exploitation by some people seeing grace as a weakness ripe for picking. And economic and game theory teaches us that agents (humans) would rationally choosoe to self-prioritize themselves, making worldwide grace an impossible state to achieve. Anecdotally, I know that I'm not that graceful either.

But perhaps such a world would not the need ardent pursuit of self-interest. And such a world would naturally remove the desire to exploit. It may just be a chicken and egg situation in the end, and that it just takes the seemingly unlikely first step to be taken by us all. Maybe one day, we can celebrate christmas filled with grace...
