## Introduction

Okay to start off, excuse my clickbaity title, but I feel that my title is appropriate (I'll explain further down). So recently I changed my jobs after a long time of deliberation. Before deciding to change jobs, I actually had another opportunity to change jobs several months ago. At that time I finally decided to not change jobs at the time for several reasons. But the things I deliberated back then were either similar or related to the things I deliberated on in my recent decision. In this blog post I would just like to share my experience and thoughts on this episode in my career

## What made me consider changing jobs?

This is related to firing myself. I liked my previous job's co-workers. I liked the product concept that the company is making and trying to iterate on. I liked my team. But there was a lack of alignment between what I felt was valued, and what I think is valuable.

I made lots of code and I enjoyed that. But besides coding I also did the following:

1. Devops
2. Best practices development
3. Processes improvement
4. CI/CD enhancement
5. AWS Resources Management
6. Establishing and iterating on code architecture
7. Trying to connect technical initiatives with business goals
8. Lunch and learns

I was doing what can be called as [glue work](https://noidea.dog/glue). I list these responsibilities not out of dislike, in fact I like to do most of them. But liking an activity is not the primary reason for taking responsibility on my shoulders. During a 1-on-1 session with my manager they asked me whether I liked to do more devops oriented work. My reply was:

> I certainly do not dislike doing it. But more than liking it or not, I do it mainly because I find it necessary for the company's quality and longevity

Necessity breeds invention they say. But while there certainly was some level of acknowledgement of the importance of the above list, there was a lack of targeted effort, attention and resources allocated to them. For those that were allocated some level of resource I felt that they were still largely lacking. It felt that that things were __just barely__ holding on due to the efforts and attention of a small number of people.

I understand that often resource allocation translates to capital allocation, which may or may not be feasible to distribute across so many necessities. But if that was the case, then I certainly expect management to step in and to work with the frontline engineers and business to align focus allowing for targeted resource allocation. I expect that gradually things would be given their due attention. If it was found that the business cannot shoulder the burden of working on so many priorities at the same time, then I expect management to make things feel and be manageable, even if that means de-prioritizing certain goals.

I expect all of these from an environment that aims to strive for lasting excellence and quality. And yet, I did not see the company move towards such an environment.

## Firing myself

"Firing" may often be seen as having a negative connotation, but my own framing of "firing" is a bit different. I had the chance to talk to my ex-CTO where I asked what skills they think is required for the company. One of the abilities they said they'd like to see from employees is the ability to fire people. What they meant is that there are going to be, for fortunate and unfortunate reasons, people that no longer align with the business. Misalignment between people and the company may include values, skills, results etc. Whatever it is, my ex-CTO thought it is important to be able to let go of such people.

I wondered why I was unsure of whether to change jobs or not. In the end I came to realize that I was no longer delivering outputs that aligns to what the business values. I felt that my focus on tackling the challenges and tasks I listed above, clashed with what the company needed at the time. The company needed more immediate business results that translates to clients' success. Of course, I strived to bring success for our clients. I see my role as an engineer not to just create technology for the sake of itself, but to create technology that aligns with a greater purpose. But alas as in all things in software engineering, things need (and are better of) to be delivered continuously and iteratively, including those that I mentioned above.

So feeling like I do not align with the company any longer, but knowing that I was definitely still an integral part of my team and company at large, I took the step to fire myself and not wait any further.

## Final thoughts

Overall, I am happy with my decision. Some may, and I did myself, argue that I should have stayed and try harder. If I really emphasized quality and really think what I did were important, then I should have aimed harder at creating buy in. I should reach further and connect people across the company. Or maybe, I should just have been a better communicator.

I do not disagree with such thoughts and I definitely see the merits of each. That's why I hesitated to change jobs myself, questioning my own motives and decisions. But I realize that I may also be impeding not just my own growth, but perhaps the company's growth too due to our misalignment. Additionally, by staying I may be delivering less impact than I can had I worked with an organization that aligns better with myself. Both sides have reasonable arguments depending on the situation and in the end I just chose what felt to be the best one.

While I do encourage everyone to seek to work for organizations (or even create ones) that aligns with themselves so that everyone can maximize their positive impact, I realize that the ability to fire oneself is a privilege. Not everyone will be able to nor afford to do it. I am certainly fortunate. Hence I hope employers continuously strive to onboard those that truly align with the organization but also be ready to adapt and shift to ensure that they themselves align with their workforce. It will require effort on all sides.

Thank you for reading thus far. I hope it has been valuable to you
