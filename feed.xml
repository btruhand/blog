<p>Happy new year 2023 everyone! I hope readers had a chance to celebrate, wind down or simply relax. Though the world doesn’t miraculously change it’s outlook or trajectory overnight, people do have a tendency to treat new years as a fresh start of sorts (you can google the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fresh start effect</code>). Indeed, who wouldn’t hope, or aspire, to be able to make life better going forward. And yet we may also feel that we will have no such luck going forward. So in this post let us talk about luck and make it less mystical and hopefully more attainable.</p>

<h2 id="a-digression-to-games">A digression to games</h2>

<p>I love playing JRPGs (japanese role-playing games). Most of these games have some form of fighting mechanic where the player can play characters that have specific attributes. One such attribute is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Luck</code>. Most of the time the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Luck</code> attribute only has influence over probabilistic battle mechanics, such as the probability of dealing a critical hit.</p>

<p>Landing a critical hit leads to dealing significantly more damage, usually by 1.25 to 2 times harder than usual. But damage is largely affected by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Attack</code> attribute. So imagine a character that pulls of a critical hit but it can only deal a low amount damage because of a low <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Attack</code>. That critical hit won’t seem so critical now…</p>

<h2 id="positioning-for-luck">Positioning for luck</h2>

<p>Like how a critical hit is unimpressive without enough investment to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Attack</code>, lucky events alone are not enough. You need to be in position to make the most of it.</p>

<p>It is indisputable that life throws random events to us. And though we can try to anticipate, a combination of (un)known unknowns, randomness and imperfect information, events of chance happen. And when chances that we can capitalize for our benefit happen, don’t we then say we’re lucky?</p>

<p>A drawn lottery number is useless to us if we do not have the right lottery ticket, though drawing ANY of the lottery number is an unlikely random event. A new project that would benefit your promotion likelihood is great, but only if you’ve set yourself up to be a part of it. You may feel lucky to meet your life partner, but you needed to take the chance when you met them.</p>

<h2 id="working-hard-for-luck">Working hard for luck</h2>

<p>Try as we may to think that we have worked hard for the life we have now, chance, randomness and a plethora of things beyond our control showcase to us that the result of our life is not simply due to our actions. This may come as a sense of reprieve for those who feel like they are given the short end of the stick in life. For those that have worked hard for the things in life, they may choose to give more credit to their efforts. And for those in the large middle they may feel stuck waiting for lady luck to chance upon them as they continue trying.</p>

<p>But effort and luck are complimentary to each other, not disjoint. To be in position to take advantage of chance, effort, whether small or large, will be needed. Paradoxically, the greatest differences may be due to the smallest of luck even <strong>after</strong> significant effort.</p>

<h2 id="athletes-as-an-example">Athletes as an example</h2>

<p>In his book <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691167404/success-and-luck">Success and Luck</a>, professor Robert H. Frank talks of highly competitive occupations e.g athletes, and how luck plays a crucial role in determining who would come ahead. If a group of athletes were to compete with each other, each of them are more than likely to be close in terms of skill, which we presume were developed through much effort.</p>

<p>We would think in such a competition, that the best of them would be the one to win. But if they were so close in skill, then the determining factor can be as small as a sliver of chance, perhaps it only makes a difference in 1 percent of cases. But such a small difference in chance can lead to a big difference of being first, or second.</p>

<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>

<p>Effort is important to make the most of luck, but luck relies on elemnts of chance. The more optimistic may see this as an opportunity of finding more luck in their life, but those with less optimism may question the efforts they are putting, if at the end it is luck (or a lack of it) that may determine the outcome.</p>

<p>Both are legitimate responses, but I would personally encourage the former than the latter. Indeed, it may be the determinant of you being lucky or not this year.</p>]]></content><author><name>btruhand</name><email>btruhand@gmail.com</email></author><category term="new year" /><category term="psychology" /><category term="opinion" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new year brings about new unexpected possibilities to grasp.

I hope you were able to spend time with your loved ones, or at least had the chance to take some reprieve from the busyness and frantic schedule that 2022 has imposed. In spirit of christmas I wanted to make this post, and excuse me ahead of time for a post that may seem to be a bit Christian centric. But I assure you this post is short and quick (no time return though, unlike gift shopping :sweat_smile:)</p>

<p>Googling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grace</code>, one of the definitions you get will be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(in Christian belief) the free and unmerited favor of God, as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now this post won’t be talking about this specific definition of grace, but it’s definitely influenced. I want to talk about the grace of humans, in particular the grace that a human may display to one another (or in extension towards non-human entities). In Christian teachings, God shows grace through for the redemption of humanity from their sin in past, present, and future through Jesus Christ(-mas). Instead of this God-centric definition here’s the definition of grace that I will use:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a deliberate decision to not use one’s power over another party that will cause harm or pain or with no regard for the best of the other party</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A bit lengthy, and you may think that this definition falls under “do no harm”/”do no evil”. Part of it is, but it goes beyond. Some examples may help:</p>

<ol>
  <li>not delivering judgement (behind/in front of them), despite moral high ground</li>
  <li>not increasing prices when you have market dominance (similarly, not using a tight labour market to demand higher pay)</li>
  <li>dropping our rights to make a claim in court towards anotheer who you feel have wronged you</li>
  <li>embracing those deemed, implicitly or explicitly, not desirable in your group</li>
  <li>not seeking tit-for-tat</li>
  <li>delivering the best for others</li>
  <li>make our resources for the benefits of others</li>
</ol>

<p>Grace in my mind is not simply to not do something, but it is the active disposition to do the best, and give the best for other parties. It demands having others at the centre of our universe instead of ourselves. And to make it even more difficult, grace should be available for everyone and not just a select few.</p>

<p>Can a world where everyone show grace towards everyone exist? What would such a world like? I naturally think that such a world will be open to unscrupulous exploitation by some people who sees grace as a weakness ripe for picking. And economic and game theory teaches us that agents (humans) would prefer to favour their self-interest, opposite of what grace requires of us. Anecdotally, I know that I’m not that graceful either, and reading the comments and reactions to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/zvnwhj/if_you_win_a_million_dollars_on_a_gift_how_much">this Reddit thread</a> seems to speak for the case of favouring self-interest. Even if it is achievable, would it be sustainable? And what conflicts or issues would arise from such a way of life?</p>

<p>But perhaps such a world would not the need ardent pursuit of self-interest. And such a world would naturally remove the desire to exploit. It may just be a chicken and egg situation in the end, and that it just takes the seemingly unlikely first step to be taken by us all.</p>

<p>Though it is difficult to envision such a world (or even it’s possibility), personally I believe it is a way of life worth striving for. Grace may not encompass all facet of our life, but we can see pockets of it sprinkled in our life. Yes, I’d like to believe that humans seek for grace, even though we may not know of it…</p>]]></content><author><name>btruhand</name><email>btruhand@gmail.com</email></author><category term="christmas" /><category term="christian" /><category term="philosophy" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In spirit of christmas, I take a quick jab at the thought of a world where everyone shows grace to one another]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/images/exploding_rubicks.gif" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/images/exploding_rubicks.gif" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">What does a software developer do?</title><link href="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2022/12/03/what-software-developers-do" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What does a software developer do?" /><published>2022-12-03T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-03T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2022/12/03/what-software-developers-do</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2022/12/03/what-software-developers-do"><![CDATA[<p>It has been a while readers! For the past year I have somewhat neglected my blog, but I assure you (or at least I hope I do) that it was for a good reason. You see for the past year or so I have been really focused at developing my career as a software developer in my current company (at least that’s what I’d rather say :sweat_smile:). Now that I feel like I would like to put up a new blog post, what could be more fitting than writing something about software development?</p>

<p>I’m sure most, if not all of us, have beeen asked with the too common question <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">what do you do (for your job)?</code> and you would answer with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I work as a &lt;insert job title&gt;</code>. And after you answer, you may feel an awkward stare that as if says <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">great, but I still don't know what you do</code> but both parties would nod in agreement to progress the conversation to some other topic. As a software developer I’ve always had a bit of difficulty explaining what being a software deeveloper means to most people around me considering that most are not realted to software development and have little knowledge with the profession. But throughout this year I have had a bit of time to think this question through and I feel like I have come to a satisfying explanation which I’d like to share:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A software developer is a profession that solves problems, with knowledge and the craft of software creation being their primary tool</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…</p>

<p>You may now be on the verge of just closing this blog post altogether after having been served with answer that is seemingly both ambiguous and obvious and thus feeling like you have wasted your precious time reading 2.5 paragraphs. But I assure you (as again I would like to believe) that I have good reason for my answer. There are two:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">problem</code> is intentionally worded as such to keep the scope of what a software developer can try to solve as wide as possible.</li>
  <li>By claiming that software developers have a primary tool, it opens up the possibility of having secondary, tertiary and more tools beyond software creation to solve problems at hand</li>
</ol>

<p>I think the first point is more self-evident. Software is abundant in our life and how much it influences our life through how, where, when and what we do whether we notice it nor not, to the point that some say that software is “eating up the world”. There are many kinds of problems to solve and while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">problem</code> itself is undescriptive, if you were to tell others that you are solving a <strong>particular</strong> kind of problem I find that it becomes easier for people to have a sense of what you are doing. They may not know the intricacies nor how you solve the problem, but it provides them a concretee point to focus on, and if they’re interested I’m sure they’ll ask you more about it or do their own research</p>

<p>Now on the second point. As software developers we are expected to use our knowledge and skills to be able to develope (and maintain) software. It is what we are primarily paid for and how we are assessed, but that doesn’t mean that is the only way we can solve problems. Some problems are very likely better solved NOT using software but using some other set of tools (queue the people trying to solve everything with artificial intelligence/machine learning :see_no_evil:). That is to say, software developers have a hammer (software creation) but not everything is a nail to be hammered away</p>

<p>Now, to my fellow software developers I would like to encourage you to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>reflect on what kind of problems you are trying to solve, and what kind of problems you want to solve</li>
  <li>how you can best use your software creation skills to tackle the problems</li>
  <li>what other tools you can bring to the table to solve the problems? what kind of tools you would like to have (skills to develop)?</li>
  <li>advocate for yourself to have the chance to get better at solving these problems, such as by seeking professional development support within and outside of software development</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Apparently in 1996 auditors of CRA (Canada Revenue Agency, the government body dealing with taxes and income) conducted a study on luxury residential properties being bought by new incoming immigrants in Burnaby, British Columbia</li>
  <li>They found that a lot of luxury properties were bought by recent immigrants to Canada. In Burnaby for properties with that is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt; $800,000</code> in purchasing value, 33 out of 48 buys in the sample were purchased by immigrants</li>
  <li>Interestingly, the average declared income among these immigrants were considerably much lower than other groups sampled in the study. Some even declared their income to be negative</li>
  <li>This raised questions surrounding potential tax evasion through global income, business or perhaps some convoluted loan schemes</li>
  <li>The study was never truly publicized and <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3146957/canada-tax-agency-reveals-secret-study-linking-home-prices">allegedly ignored</a>. It surfaced only after 5 years of a process called “Access to Information and Privacy” (ATIP)</li>
  <li>One of the reasons that Canadians consider to be a factor to the ever increasing prices of residential properties is foreign buyers with greater purchasing power buying properties. This report will likely make their concerns even larger</li>
  <li>At the same time the study was primarily focused on luxury properties, and at least based on the study itself there is no clear indication of how luxury property purchased with foreign money impact the overall property market</li>

<h1 id="rent-control-inefficacy"><a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/rent-control/">Rent control inefficacy</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Rent control is sometimes proposed as part of a solution to combat housing unaffordability. But it may not be as desirable as one would think</li>
  <li>Imposing rent control can lead to decrease in overall housing supply throughout the years that rent control is enforced. The reasons assume assumptions on the rational behaviour of landlords and real estate developers. Essentially due to the capped potential profit, suppliers have less incentive to supply properties as rentals and when this situation is prolonged it can lead to severe undersupply</li>
  <li>At the same time rent control does positive effects on reducing the displacement of residents. In other words, residents can keep staying at the same place</li>
  <li>However, rent control also disincentivizes people to move to other locations which may impede their economic mobility, but also further restricts the options of future incoming residents. Future residents are likely to have to find residence in a non-rent control place</li>
  <li>Overall, rent control seems to benefit the immediate at the expense of future</li>
  <li>And yet, removing rent control itself won’t be the best course of action given the likelihood of undersupply in areas with rent control. Removing rent control without other supporting actions would only serve to displace people and exacerbate the housing affordability problem</li>
  <li>To me the whole debacle of housing affordability, from the lens of rent control, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the commons</a>. All sides would like an outcome that suits their best interest but they often conflict with one another and decisions that tilt one favorably over another may be a short term net benefit but a long term problem. In this case the issuance of some versions of rent control may have ironically made things more unaffordable when moving forward into the future</li>
  <li>Rent control also seems to be a rough attempt in creating the positive effects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax">land value tax</a></li>

<h1 id="curation-economy"><a href="https://gaby.mirror.xyz/LGrzJJbwV9ewhYAa7gcFYa2nxYlTWRH-SxmSuViEWA4">Curation economy</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>The amount of content out there in the world to be consumed is ever expanding and inundates us with choice paralysis</li>
  <li>But we desire to consume content as part of our ever digitalized life and media loving generation</li>
  <li>There seems to be an increasing amount of willingness to pay for high quality content. These companies or ventures that thrive on the collection of curated content are called curators</li>
  <li>From the author’s perspective, a curation must also be based on an underlying theme, that you can cultivate to a brand from</li>
  <li>Some curators or forms of curation that come to my mind include: podcasts, <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/daily">Morning Brew</a>, YouTube channels, <a href="https://www.hiatus.net/">Hiatus</a></li>
  <li>This series in itself is a curation of things I found interesting</li>
  <li>Non media content curation may include ventures like <a href="https://www.hellofresh.ca/">HelloFresh</a>, and you may try to stretch that dating apps are also a form of curation</li>
  <li>I wholly agree that curation is going to play a bigger role in our future of consumption as the number of content, and also poorly made ones, increase and get sieved through our perceptions, values, ideas and culture</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="negativity-bias"><a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/reasons-to-be-cheerful-rebroadcast/">Negativity bias</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Negativity bias is the tendency to focus on the negatives, more so on the positives. The higher amount of focus and attention given to negative events and aspects leads us to be more attentive and attracted, perhaps worryingly so, to such events dulling the positive impacts of positive events</li>
  <li>This trait of us to focus on negative events seems to be understood as a form of generally true statement in psychology</li>
  <li>You probably also notice that much of the news media, traditional or more contemporary like in our social media feeds, has a tendency to gravitate towards negative events. They know how to cash in on our attention</li>
  <li>A general rule of thumb is that it takes <b>4 good things</b> to offset the psychological impact of <b>1 bad thing</b></li>
  <li><em>“Life has to win every day. Death only has to win once”</em> - Roy Baumeister, psychologist. Our negativity bias may have come about from evolutionary needs to stay alive by avoiding the negative and even dangerous moments in life. Our ancestors had to live a life of struggle against the wilderness and spurious events that was literally life and death moments</li>
  <li>If negativity bias was an evolutionary line of defense, it may not be as needed anymore in our modern days. Certainly the dangers of the wilderness is less faced by most of us. And we have systems and mechanisms in place, while imperfect, that are doing better at keeping us safe from what used to endanger our ancestors.</li>
  <li>The focus on what is negative may make us lose sight of what is truly important and what is possible. This may lead us to sub-optimal decisions, whether in the short or long run</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="fairness-as-a-constraint-on-profit-seeking"><a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://www.jstor.org/stable/1806070">Fairness as a Constraint on Profit Seeking</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Economics 101 would tell you that what dictates price is the law of supply and demand. But while it is certainly fundamental in pricing mechanisms, it is not the only factor that influences pricing. Daniel Kahnemann et al. finds that rules of fairness puts certain limitations on how prices can move</li>
  <li>The researches posited that when it comes to what is fair, consumers as market participants deem what is fair through an assessment that the researchers call the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dual-entitlement view</code></li>
  <li>Dual-entitlement view is the view that:
    <ul>
      <li>It is not fair for suppliers of goods and services to charge a higher price if it means that transactors will incur at a loss. This applies <strong>EVEN IF</strong> there legitimate cost increases. <em>Note that transactors in the study includes customers, tenants or employees</em></li>
      <li>It is fair for suppliers of goods and services to gain profit by taking advantage of cost reductions, even if such cost reductions are not necessarily caused or induced by the suppliers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>These are some hypotethical scenarios in the study that were deemed unfair, but would be possible through pure supply and demand mechanisms:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>A hardware store has been selling snow shovels for $15. The morning after a large snowstorm, the store raises the price to $20</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>A small photocopying shop has one employee who has worked in the shop for six months and earns $9 per hour. Business continues to be satisfactory, but a factory in  the area has closed and unemployment has increased. Other small shops have now hired reliable workers at $7 an hour to perform jobs similar to those done by the photocopy shop employee. The owner of the photocopying shop reduces the employee’s wage to $7</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The researchers claims that many people accounts loss and profit in what is called <em>naive accounting</em>. Naive accounting takes into account the <em>reference pricing</em> of the situation rather than the final end state of profit and loss. Rational pricing frameworks suggest what matters is the final end state, not the relative intermediate changes</li>
  <li>They also noticed that people are more adverse to perceptions of loss than gains.</li>
  <li>Perceptions of loss and gain along with naive accounting have significant impacts are significantly influenced by the framing of the situation. Even though the final accounting state may be the same, certain situations may be deemed unfair:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>A small company employs several people. The workers’ incomes have 
been about average for the community. In recent months, business for the company has not increased as it had before. The owners reduce the workers’ wages by 10 percent for the next year.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>A small company employs several people. The workers have been receiving a 10 percent annual bonus  each year and their total incomes have  been about average for the community. In recent months, business for  the company has not increased as it had before. The owners eliminate the workers’ bonus for the year.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>In both scenarios the firm ends up with 10% in extra profit kept. However, the first scenario was deemed predominantly as unfair while the second one being fair by research participants</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There are some economic consequences to the perceptions of fairness by market participants. Many of the ramifications that the researchers posited involve the failure of markets in delivering goods, services and labor at prices that supply and demand curve would suggest is appropriate. Inability to raise prices, or lower wages, in certain situations may lead to inbalances in the demand and supply that causes excess in one way or another. Economically speaking this leads to negative externalities</li>
  <li>Some recent pricing events that come to my mind related to this study are:
    <ul>
      <li>Shrinkflation, the practice of reducing amount of packaged goods but at the same price. Consumers are likely to be less perceptive in what seems to be neither gain nor loss, even though the end state, the price per unit may steadily increase</li>
      <li>Canada’s housing is widely accepted to be undersupplied, and during the pandemic has skyrocketed in demand along with increased prices.

<p>Okay to start off, excuse my clickbaity title, but I feel that my title is appropriate (I’ll explain further down). So recently I changed my jobs after a long time of deliberation. Before deciding to change jobs, I actually had another opportunity to change jobs several months ago. At that time I finally decided to not change jobs at the time for several reasons. But the things I deliberated back then were either similar or related to the things I deliberated in my recent decision. In this blog post I would just like to share my experience and thoughts on this episode in my career</p>

<h2 id="what-made-me-consider-changing-jobs">What made me consider changing jobs?</h2>

<p>The decision to fire myself is inextricable from the considerations to change my job. So let’s start from there.</p>

<p>First of all, I liked my previous job’s co-workers. I also liked the product concept that the company is making and trying to iterate on. I liked my team. But there was a lack of alignment between what I felt was valued, and what I think is valuable. This misalignment turned to be the main catalyst.</p>

<p>I made lots of code and I enjoyed that. And besides coding I also did the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Devops</li>
  <li>Best practices development</li>
  <li>Processes improvement</li>
  <li>CI/CD enhancement</li>
  <li>AWS Resources Management</li>
  <li>Establishing and iterating on code architecture</li>
  <li>Trying to connect technical initiatives with business goals</li>
  <li>Lunch and learns</li>
</ol>

<p>I was doing what can be called as <a href="https://noidea.dog/glue">glue work</a>, which in essence is all the things things that connect various aspects of the organization in order to make the software product and projects run well. I list these responsibilities not out of dislike, in fact I like to do most of them. But liking an activity is not the primary reason for taking responsibility on my shoulders. During a 1-on-1 session with my manager they asked me whether I liked to do more devops oriented work. My reply was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I certainly do not dislike doing it. But more than liking it or not, I do it mainly because I find it necessary for the company’s quality and longevity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Necessity breeds invention they say. But while there were some level of acknowledgement of the importance of the above, there was a lack of targeted effort, attention and resources allocated to them. And for those that were allocated some resources, I felt they were lacking. It felt that that things were <strong>just barely</strong> holding on due to the efforts and attention given by a small number of people on glue work.</p>

<p>I understand that often resource allocation translates to capital allocation, which may or may not be feasible to distribute across so many necessities. But if that was the case, then I certainly expect management to step in and to work with the frontline engineers and business to align focus allowing for targeted resource allocation. I expect that gradually things would be given their due attention. If it was found that the business cannot shoulder the burden of working on so many priorities at the same time, then I expect management to make things feel and be manageable, even if that means de-prioritizing certain goals.</p>

<p>I expect all of these from an environment that aims to strive for lasting excellence and quality. And yet, I did not see the company move towards such an environment.</p>

<h2 id="firing-myself">Firing myself</h2>

<p>“Firing” is often seen as having a negative connotation, but my own framing of “firing” is a bit different. I had the chance to talk to my ex-CTO where I asked what skills they think are required for the company. One of the abilities they said they’d like to see from employees is the ability to fire people. What they meant is that there are going to be, for fortunate and unfortunate reasons, people that no longer align with the business. Misalignment between people and the company may include values, skills, results etc. Whatever the misalignment may be, my ex-CTO thought it is important to be able to let go of such people.</p>

<p>I wondered why I was unsure of whether to change jobs or not. In the end I came to realize that I was no longer delivering outputs that aligns to what the business values. I felt that my focus on tackling the challenges and tasks I listed above, clashed with what the company needed at the time. The company needed and seeked for more immediate business results that translates to clients’ success. Of course, I strived to bring success for our clients. I see my role as an engineer not to just create technology for the sake of itself, but to create technology that aligns with a greater purpose. In order to deliver those values I identified that the iterative and continous improvements on glue work were needed. Meanwhile, with the numerous projects accompanied with statically defined delivery schedules, as time goes on it became clearer that how I deliver value does not align with how the company delivers value. I knew there was a misalignment because though I often bring the topic of the need for continued organizational effort on glue work, I did not see changes materialize.</p>

<p>I knew that I was an integral part of the team. And I also knew that I am not in alignment with the company any longer. So instead of waiting for things to feel worse for both me and the company, I took the step to fire myself rather than prolong the situation. By firing myself I let the myself depart from the idealistic vision of what I think work should be like within the company. At the same time I also gave the opportunity to the company to re-allocate the resources and energy they spent on me towards others (potentially a new hire) that would better suit their needs.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall, I am happy with my decision. Some may, and I did myself, argue that I should have stayed and try harder. If I really emphasized quality and really think what I did were important, then I should have aimed harder at creating buy in. I should reach further and connect people across the company. Or maybe, I should just have been a better communicator.</p>

<p>I do not disagree with such thoughts and I definitely see the merits of each. That’s why I hesitated to change jobs myself, questioning my own motives and decisions. But I realize that I may also be impeding not just my own growth, but perhaps the company’s growth too due to our misalignment. Additionally, by staying I may be delivering less impact than I can had I worked with an organization that aligns better with myself. Both sides have reasonable arguments depending on the situation and in the end I just chose what felt to be the best one.</p>

<p>While I do encourage everyone to seek to work for organizations (or even create ones) that aligns with themselves so that everyone can maximize their positive impact, I realize that the ability to fire oneself is a privilege. Not everyone will be able to nor afford to do it. I am certainly fortunate. Hence I hope employers continuously strive to onboard those that truly align with the organization but also be ready to adapt and shift to ensure that they themselves align with their workforce. It will require effort on all sides.</p>

<p>If you are a Canadian reader headlines of large price increases on real estate, particularly on housing real estate, is likely not foreign to you. In 2021. A quick search yields <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/canadian-home-sales-prices-surge-to-new-record-in-march-1.5388622">an article</a> that says Canadian house prices rose by 31.6% from March 2020 (start of COVID-19 pandemic) to March 2021.</p>

<p>On another <a href="https://housepriceindex.ca/2021/07/june2021/">report</a>, most major cities in Canada have had their highest real estate during the COVID-19 pandemic. The surge on real estate prices is taken note by Bank of Canada as a <a href="https://betterdwelling.com/boc-governor-says-canada-will-lean-on-real-estate-because-we-need-the-growth/">significant economic driving force</a> with residiential real estate investment accounting for over 9% of gross domestic product. Increase in residential real estate prices, along with accomodative monetary policies such as low interest rates have prompted investments into residential real estate to <a href="https://betterdwelling.com/canadians-now-pump-more-into-residential-real-estate-than-business-development/">slightly eclipse</a> that of non-residential’s. <a href="https://financialpost.com/investing/david-rosenberg-housing-is-keeping-canadas-economy-going-and-thats-bad-news-when-the-bubble-pops">Some are opining that Canada’s economiy is over-reliant</a> on the residential real estate market, with investments on productive assets being thwarted by the chase on real estate investments.</p>

<p>In general, money goes where returns shine the brightest and certainly the Canadian housing market is shining bright hot in price. Considering residential, or housing’s, status of both as a consumption and asset it brings both pain and joy throughout the economy. For those that have entered into the real estate ownership, there is surely some joy having an asset that appreciates (though I personally contest this notion of housing as an asset). <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/housing-in-crisis-3-in-4-canadians-who-want-a-house-can-t-afford-one-829319771.html">But for many</a>, it can be painful thinking of ever growing house prices.</p>

<h2 id="price-reasoning">Price Reasoning</h2>

<p>It has always perplexed me that house prices continue to rise especially if it does so in extraordinary numbers. Check out this <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesEagle17/status/1377353707478601729">Twitter thread</a> for an infographic of how much Canada’s house prices have risen. The <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/46-28-0001/2019001/article/00002-eng.htm">ever increasing housing price has continued to outpace income in growth</a> making house affordability an increasing pain point throughout the country. You see it in headlines and probably have conversations with it online and offline. As someone that do not have their own house and who may (or may not) choose to buy one in the future in Canada, it is definitely a situation that is worrisome. Even if you are not planning to buy some housing property it is still an economical and social concern. For those in governing seats, it is likely a political concern too. What can we do about this?</p>

<p>To hope to answer the question we would need to assess reasons for why house prices have continued to grow. Some of the common reasons that I have seen and heard are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Low interest rates</li>
  <li>Discrepancy on supply and demand</li>
  <li>Speculation money driving up prices</li>
  <li>An accommodative government that will not tolerate house prices to drop</li>
  <li>Increasing foreign investments or buyers</li>
  <li>Hiding laundered money through buying properties</li>
  <li>Pro-buying programs such as first time home owner</li>
</ol>

<p>And then there is the classic - all of the above and more, which I agree is probably the case with each point having some degree of relevance. But on this series I would like to focus on the third reason, speculation.</p>

<h2 id="land-and-speculation">Land and Speculation</h2>

<p>What is it that is being speculated on with housing and how does that speculation get reflected in price? I think we can all agree that in general, over time a house’s condition will deteriorate if maintenance is not properly given. Much like a car that is used over time, it will lose its price as its value is eked over time. A house’s design has a certain of sense and fashion to it which may gain in popularity much like fashion and may come and go in popularity. But such ebb and flow in consumer taste is hardly a reason for an endemic increase in price. So neither the interior nor exterior quality of a house by in itself may drive us to speculate on its price. Then it must be something else, and based on the title of this article, it is the land of the house that can be speculated to increase in value and hence price.</p>

<p>For the most part, the available land to us is static and no one can truly produce more of it. Okay, maybe there are instances where land is “created” (or reclaimed) land like in the <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/polders-and-dikes-of-the-netherlands-1435535">Netherlands</a> or in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reclamation_in_Singapore">Singapore</a>, but these instances are few in contrast to the vast land that we have. Or perhaps you say that land is being lost due to <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/sinking-land-rising-seas-dual-crises-facing-coastal-communities">land sinking based on effects of climate change</a>. Okay find, but land sinking isn’t what we humans consciously work for in the economy like how you or I work at our jobs. Land, for the most part, is simply not something we produce, it’s supply is fixed (pre-dominantly) by what mother nature gives to us.</p>

<p>Then if land is fixed, supply and demand from economics 101 will tell us that price can only increase as a matter of demand. So when we speculate on the value of land we speculate that the price of land will increase as a function of higher demand. Why will a particular piece of land gain or lose demand? Because the land is surrounded by or removed of other valuable things (including other valuable land). The things of value built surrounding a particular land is a function of economic investments and market or community participation. Acknowledgement of the participation of a greater community is key to understand that the value of land is not beholden to anyone.</p>

<h2 id="land-value-is-not-owned-by-anyone">Land Value is Not Owned by Anyone</h2>

<p>So let us recap:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Land’s supply is fixed and no person can increase or decrease its price through direct production</li>
  <li>Land gains value by what it is surrounded by and the community and market that participates on it and it’s surrounding</li>
</ol>

<p>Through these two observation we can claim that <em>land’s value is not owned by anyone</em>. Of course in a system of capitalism there is a notion of private ownership. Land itself can be privately owned for purposes such as building a business on top of it, or to live on it. But it’s value cannot be privately owned, because it’s value is not a function of one’s own work but that of mother nature’s and society as a whole. This is what Henry George argues for in his book <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-progress-and-poverty">Progress and Poverty</a>. But our friend George here goes further than just defining land value, George wants to tax the land value we are standing and living on!</p>

<h2 id="land-value-tax-and-speculation">Land Value Tax and Speculation</h2>

<p>George’s land value tax (LVT) is a simple proposal: put a tax on the value of the land. George goes further to say that LVT is the only tax that is needed to fund everything. He also contends that it is the most just tax to impose because no one owns the value of land (he allows land ownership, just not ownership over it’s value).</p>

<p>To make it even more starking George wants to tax 100% of the value of land. Partly again becasue of the no ownership over land value. Another reason is because George thinks that this would help dampen speculation.</p>

<p>Why would it be so? Well consider someone who is a house flipper that aims to buy some house property and sell it in a year or so. This person thinks that the price of the house will increase in the future without them needing to do <em>improvements</em> on top of it. To make it concrete say they bought for 500k CAD, and in a year they manage to sell for 600k CAD making a 100k revenue. Minus transaction costs and fees they may take home 50k in profit. But remember that they did not make any improvement to the property, thus the government can say that the price increase was wholly due to some land value increase. So through a 100% LVT they will be taxed on the full 50k profit or 100k revenue, depending on how the tax policy is enacted. No economic agent looking to make a profit will bother with flipping a house anymore because there is no profitable incentive to do so.</p>

<p>What if the flipper did decide to make some improvements to the house and sell higher based on the improvements? Then based on George’s LVT, they are entitled to the profits of their improvements. And since George advocates as LVT as the only tax, the profit from improvements will not be taxed. So if they made a 20k CAD improvement on the property, and sold it for 50k CAD, they are entitled on the full 30k profit.</p>

<h2 id="is-lvt-feasible">Is LVT Feasible?</h2>

<p>There are already some forms of LVT around the world, though not to the same degree that George laid it out. But there does seem to be government funding that is similar to essence with LVT. One such recent funding is <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2021/07/3500-mhz-auction--process-and-results.html">Canada’s 5G broadband auction</a>. While not deemed as tax, you can easily think of it as a one time tax for Canadian telecom providers that wish to supply 5G connectivity.</p>

<p>Just like how in LVT the government mandates that no one has ownership over land, the spectrum’s value is also not owned by anyone since they are simply leased through a license by the government. The spectrum’s value is for all, stewarded by the government in this case. The perception of the auction bids as a form of tax on future profits is also <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/quebec-cable-firm-surprises-with-5g-spending-spree-in-canada">reflected in the stock market of the highest bidders</a></p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The encounter with LVT while thinking about what can be done about Canadian housing price has been a delight. I do think that LVT can be applied to try and curb the speculative sensation of the Canadian housing market. Dampening down speculation should help bring down, or at least keep house prices down at a reasonable price or growth rate. Meanwhile the proceeds from LVT can be used to fund public goods, and even perhaps a universal basic income as a way to disperse the riches of Canadian lands to the public.</p>

<p>In part 2 I will be briefly look at the economic and policy implications of LVT.</p>]]></content><author><name>btruhand</name><email>btruhand@gmail.com</email></author><category term="housing" /><category term="real estate" /><category term="taxation" /><category term="policy" /><category term="economics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the price of housing in Canada having risen drastically I was thinking of what can be done for the housing prices of the future generation.

As software engineers, or even business management these days, the word agile is everywhere. In job postings, in company slogans, in company talks, on our computer screens, and in our purported work values. But I know from personal feelings, observations and anecdotes there is some distaste to “Agile” and that it feels more as hype and even worse at times feels like a marketing tool to attract talent which sadly does not deliver.</p>

<p>So as per my usual inquiring-and-chatty-self I asked the two gents, “So, what does agile mean to you?”. And I purposefully directed the question to them through the vocabulary “you” because I want to understand their own personal mental model of Agile. I do not care about Scrum, Kanban or whatever new Agile framework out there is, I wanted to get to the fundamental of Agile.</p>

<p>The first said that for him Agile is all about doing breaking up the work and taking them up. He stated that the importance is not in the pointing mechanism itself, but more in actually being able to take up and do the work. The other said that Agile for him is all about the small iterative steps that is aimed for continuous refinement.</p>

<p>I think these kind of mental models of Agile is quite common. Generally they are surmised by these adjectives or nouns: ‘iterative’, ‘small’, ‘continuous improvement’. But I would like to further refine this understanding of iteration. So let’s do that in this post, let’s try to develop a better mental model of Agile.</p>

<p>Here is my take:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main abstraction provided by Agile is experimentation</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="experimentation-first-the-rest-is-by-product">Experimentation first, the rest is by-product</h1>

<p>As software engineers we love to abstract things away, to turn details into common patterns that can be encoded as a set of computer interactions (algorithms basically) to solve a problem, or class of problems. As a software engineer I posit that the main abstraction that Agile brings is experimentation in order to solve the problem of business development and innovation.</p>

<p>And when I say experimentation, I really mean experimentation as in the scientific method sense:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/The_Scientific_Method.svg/1024px-The_Scientific_Method.svg.png" />
    <figcaption>A picture of the scientific method, which is an on-going process. Source - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">Wikipedia</a>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Since I posit that Agile is really all about experimentation brought to business practice, then there are four elements that businesses adopting Agile must absolutely meet:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A hypothesis to test</li>
  <li>Mechanisms to perform tests for or against the hypothesis</li>
  <li>The gathering of, and capability to assess data</li>
  <li>A commitment and understanding to learn and adapt continuously based on feedback of previous experiments</li>
</ol>

<p>When viewing and applying Agile as experimentation through the scientific method towards business, iteration and continuous improvement is a given. It simply becomes a by-product. Small requires an additional perspective which I will touch later on, but I assure you that it remains a by-product.</p>

<h1 id="on-hypotheses-and-testing">On hypotheses and testing</h1>

<p>Now I would like to touch on hypothesization and testing because as a software engineer this is where a lot of software engineer’s time is spent struggling on. It shouldn’t and definitely isn’t the only phase in the Agile cycle where software engineers are involved in, but I find a lot of software engineers along with their business counterparties stumble in these areas often. The stumbles that occur here impede the whole Agile flow, and impacts its adoption within a team and potentially organization at large.</p>

<h2 id="poorly-made-hypotheses">Poorly made hypotheses</h2>

<p>The development of the hypothesis is often estranged from the software engineers’ work and by that I mean something like the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Business asks for a feature &gt; Business comes up with requirements &gt; Business forks over requirements to engineers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two problems with this kind of “hypothesization”:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It isn’t really framed as a hypothesis. A hypothesis is about creating an assumption that is meant to be further investigated. Hence a hypothesis must always be made with the presupposition and even expectation that it may be false or incorrect. So a rewording may say that “Business thinks that a feature would be useful to be developed” instead. <a href="https://youtu.be/eozFlgu6ByY">Dave Farley in his video</a> covers this idea of expecting false assumptions further and better than I do</li>
  <li>The software engineers are often the people who procure the experimentation “ingredients” (code and machineries) and make the testing of the hypothesis possible. When the those that are creating the test experiments are not involved in the development of the hypothesis, there is significant risk that what would be setup does not reflect what the hypothesis is claiming. In other words - what software engineers develop may stray away tremendously from what the business actually needs</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="failure-to-perform-tests-for-the-hypothesis">Failure to perform tests for the hypothesis</h2>

<p>Assuming that the software engineers have managed to scrounged up some code for the hypothesis, Agile as experimentation would say the next step is to test that the hypothesis is correct. You can also say you can (and probably should) test that the implementation of the hypothesis is correct. But too many organizations forego this step, likely because they do not think of Agile as experimentation. The result of this in my experience usually leads to (in order of severity and face-palm worthiness, with some embellishment):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Never testing it because the software never got released in fear of what can go wrong (and also not knowing what can go right)</li>
  <li>Letting the majority of the users be the one and only tester of the hypothesis - it’s not a bug, it’s a feature (or it’s not a feature, it’s a bug)</li>
  <li>Business performs tests on their side only at the very end when every hypothesis are realized as code. Then they spectacularly notice that nothing works as hypothesized</li>
  <li>Software engineers never testing out their code and solution before running experiments. Usually exacerbating the length of feedback loops and by the time they are aware of issues highlighted in experiment results they already forgot what they did</li>
  <li>Silo’d QA teams that have no idea what is happening and have poor awareness of the hypothesis that needs to be tested</li>
</ol>

<p>The lack of testing, and the inability to perform testing whether because of technological unreadiness or organizational politics impedes the collection of data. Without this data, Agile breaks down because the next experiment cycle will be disconnected from the previous. And even if the next experiment cycle does not have anything to do with the previous one, without testing the experiment cycle is incomplete. Yet many teams and businesses readily jump in to the next experiment without really finishing the previous one at all.</p>

<p>It must be noted that the procurement of data and testing of the hypothesis in Agile may come from various tests and groups of testers. This idea of diverse testers should be intuitive in both its concept and also importance. In fact, the differing kinds of testers at times also help keep the experiment iteration small. For example, software engineers as testers is likely (or hopefully) testing a small piece of the hypothesis in a fairly quick manner, keeping the experiment and feedback fast and small.</p>

<h1 id="failures-in-adopting-agile">Failures in adopting Agile</h1>

<p>Now that we’ve postulated Agile as primarily an experimentation it becomes we can look at the potential concrete reasons why Agile adoption fails. And here is where the pscyhology aspect of working with or within Agile becomes more prominent.</p>

<h2 id="mischaracterization-of-agile">Mischaracterization of Agile</h2>

<p>The first thing that is quite likely to have happened is that the organization has mischaracterized Agile as a set of procedures and formal methodologies. This is exactly not what Agile was meant to be based on the Agile manifesto. The focus is likely to have been aimed at adopting Scrum or Kanban methodologies while missing the essence of Agile; an abstraction for scientific experimentation for the business problems.</p>

<h2 id="closing-off-from-being-wrong">Closing off from being wrong</h2>

<p>If you watched Dave Farley’s video that I linked above you should understand where I am coming from with this. Experimentation necessitates that there is an uncertainty that wants to be further investigated. By nature this must mean that incorrect hypothesis and even seemingly unfruitful effort will be made as business attempt to solve problems through products, services and processes.</p>

<p>The idea of being wrong is psychologically difficult to reconciliate with. There is also a social dimension to it which hits some people harder than others, for legitimate and illegitimate reason. But even disregarding that, our brain and ego often limits our ability to accept mistakes, by others or ourselves.</p>

<h2 id="inability-to-change">Inability to change</h2>

<p>The scientific method is a continuous loop. Each loop may feed in new data points and observations for the next loop. Iteration is enabled by the successive feed of data from one step to another. But some experiments will inevitably challenge our assumptions and hence our cycle. More likely though, challenges will come from external sources Agile processes. It is unlikely that your Agile journey will be a sequence of smooth loops; they say the only constant is change.</p>

<p>Disregarding turbulent external change, Agile itself promotes change, and so it must be something that teams and organizations can work and be comfortable with. But inherently change is difficult to do. There is technical aspect of change which is difficult in itself which covers aspects of software design, architecture, CI/CD and many more. Then there is the fragility of our human cognition in accepting change.</p>

<p>The need for change may be brought by previously held incorrect hypothesis or experimentations. And we’ve said that accepting being wrong in itself is already hard. Even if it isn’t necessitated by previous missteps we may be prone to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias">status quo bias</a>. Or perhaps we have a <a href="https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/sunk-cost-fallacy/">sunk cost fallacy</a> towards our previous assumptions. Erroneously, some organizations may situate themselves to be unable to respond to the need for change because of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-history_illusion">end-of-history illusion</a></p>

<h2 id="uncontrolled-change">Uncontrolled change</h2>

<p>Some organizations do change, to the point of being overwhelmed by change. Change is difficult, and more so when change happens frequently and in an unstructured fashion. The COVID-19 pandemic has thought us that we need to change our long-held practices. But the deluge, abrupt and perhaps unprecedented scale of change that needs to be adapted for the modern era made many of us grind to a halt.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of our difficulty when change is uncontrolled:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Small businesses anguish at ever changing regulations and response turbulence</li>
  <li>Health officials saying they are doing science by looking and listening to the evidence that is constantly changing based on new data points. To many it seems these officials are flip-flopping and changing their stance or suggestions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scrum, Kanban and other Agile methodologies particularly shine here by bringing in a framework that acts as a guidance. In particular the emphasis on the dissection of experiments into smaller pieces helps to make change feel and be manageable. But these methodologies work best when the change being brought are iterative towards some form of north star, a loose trajectory guidance. When the north star itself is what keeps changing, many will find it difficult to handle what often becomes uncontrolled change.</p>

<h2 id="industrial-friction">Industrial friction</h2>

<p>Assuming that individuals within the organization themselves can apply Agile as a way of experimentation, there are still industrial challenges to the adoption of Agile. Such challenges may come internally or externally.</p>

<p>Internally, the problems mentioned above can equally be replicated and exacerbated on the organizational level. So there are the pscyhological dimensions on the individual and corporate that needs to be addressed in the adoption of Agile. Many organizations are still not comfortable yet in performing experiments; in hypothesizing, testing, analyzing data and rinse and repeat. They view business problems as work that needs to be steamrolled in one go.</p>

<p>Externally, some organizations are situated within an industry that makes experimentation difficult. These industries often have low tolerance for mistakes. Arguably all industries are intolerant for mistakes, but some just feel more daunting than others, whether that is true or not is another topic.</p>

<p>Despite internal or external friction, it is possible to adopt Agile methodologies in gradients. While indeed Agile can be adopted within the context of “move fast and break things”, it can also be adapted in more nuanced and smaller scale. I take inspiration from SpaceX that continuously runs launch experiments against their hypothetical products. The level of funding needed to run these experiments, which may end with million-dollars fireworks, is ludicrously high. Yet, SpaceX shows that it is possible that Agile is possible even in high-stake.</p>

<p>So instead of fully backing off from Agile, we can try to see at which parts of our organizations do Agile make sense and in what form. At the very least I think all software engineering teams can and should adopt Agile by adopting CI/CD pipelines.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Dave Farley has a <a href="https://youtu.be/v8f6q4ruvds">video</a> more on SpaceX.</p>

<h1 id="final-comments">Final comments</h1>

<p>When I hear Agile, I always think of the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>. We know that at the heart of it Agile is not Scrum, and it is not Kanban. I posit it as the abstraction of the scientific experimentation to solve business problems.</p>

<p>Seeing Agile as experimentation puts a lot of emphasis on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Working software</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Responding to change</code> of the Manifesto. In particular, the Agile experiments are there to serve as a way to create software that works (for customers, not just for computers) according to battle-tested hypotheses. The experimental loop fundamentally necessitates organizations to expect change from the Agile cycles, and also from external forces.</p>

<p>Hopefully this helps you in truly bringing Agile changes to your organization.</p>]]></content><author><name>btruhand</name><email>btruhand@gmail.com</email></author><category term="software development" /><category term="management" /><category term="organizational techniques" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post I posit that the heart of Agile is scientific experimentation and not any of the marketed Agile methodologies like Scrum, Kanban etc.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/images/exploding_rubicks.gif" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/images/exploding_rubicks.gif" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">EUPHORIA - An acronym for financial well-being</title><link href="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2021/05/02/euphoria-acronym" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="EUPHORIA - An acronym for financial well-being" /><published>2021-05-02T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-05-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2021/05/02/euphoria-acronym</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2021/05/02/euphoria-acronym"><![CDATA[<p>It has been a while since my latest blog post and this time I’m writing out of whimsical inspiration. I was browsing the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/">PersonalFinanceCanada sub-Reddit</a> and saw a question about being mindful of lifestyle creep. If you don’t know what lifestyle creep is, it basically means ever increasingly extravagant lifestyle, usually marked with fancier material posessions, dinners or experiences. It usually coincides with increases in salary, relocation or a momentous life event (such as a financial windfall).</p>

<p>Usually (though not everyone necessarily sees this way), lifestyle creep has a negative connotation, particularly because it usually hampers someone’s ability to save for their future. Suffice to say that the poster of the thread was of that mindset. So I came up with the acronym <strong>EUPHORIA</strong>, hoping that it can be of help to the poster. And I hope an expansion of the acronym in this blog post will also help you.</p>

<h1 id="e---envision-where-you-want-to-be">E - Envision where you want to be</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.halhershfield.com/">Hal Hershfield</a>, a UCLA researcher in the domain of behavioural decision making has conducted studies into the <a href="https://www.halhershfield.com/research-index">effectiveness of envisioning yourself into the future</a>. He contends that interestingly, often we treat ourselves in the future as completely different people.</p>

<p>While at first it may be surprising, intuitively you can kind of see why that may be the case. It is unsurprising to us now that though the world is ever more connected through the Internet, the lack of physical proximity may still cause a toll in our connection and relationship with others. Similarly ourselves in the future are temporally distant to ourselves. But at the very least space is arguably a visible and felt concept while time is more nebulous and seemingly unfelt, and you certainly never feel like slamming against time as you do against a wall. Compound this with the idea of trying to project yourself into the future several years ahead and you would likely have a hard time accurately depicting what you will be like into the future.</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I certainly have moments of surprises when I think back what I was like 5 years ago compared to how I am now. I find it surprising not because of how extraordinarily different I am now than what I hope to be, but simply because I didn’t even imagine a world where I am like I am now. In his research Hal and his colleagues identified that given effective cues to both visually and imaginatively one’s future self, those that were studied were able to make better savings decisions. They contend that the exercise helped create a connection between the present and future selves which helped participants to <strong>discount future rewards less</strong>. In other words they were better able to appreciate the value of delayed gratification.</p>

<h1 id="u---understand-yourself">U - Understand yourself</h1>

<p>If self envisioning can help you to more seriously aim for desired future targets to achieve, then the next question would be to ask what kind of targets you would like to pursue. While you can try to envision what, how and where you want to be in the future, it is still notoriously difficult to understand the <em>why</em> of the goals you are making. In a <a href="/blog/post/2021/01/05/what-matters-given-you">previous blog post</a> I talked a bit on the topic of exploring what matters for yourself. In the post I advocate for the notion of focusing on your situation to find out what is important for you. The blog post was inspired by the larger notion of self-understanding.</p>

<p>Consider the following quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The hardest but most important financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving - Morgan Housel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is it so hard? Morgan argues that in order to keep the goalpost from moving requires a sense of having enough. But our sense of needs and wants live in a continuum scale, and probability will tell you that identifying the chances of a single point in the scale to materialize is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution#Continuous_probability_distribution">a flat zero</a></p>

<p>But a perfect understanding of what is enough for us need not be the case. We simply need to be able to narrow it down enough to a small band of area in the needs and wants spectrum such that we can confidently say that anywhere within this small band we are content and can continue to be so. To be able narrow the ban BUT also stay confident in our judgement of what brings us contentment, joy, happiness, fulfillment etc. the ability to understand ourself is needed.</p>

<p>Here’s an example: for myself I am keeping a “decision log” that tracks my investment decisions. It helps me record and assess my actions such that I don’t just understand myself by how I feel, but also by what I actually did.</p>

<h1 id="p---prioritize-what-is-important-not-what-is-nice">P - Prioritize what is important, not what is nice</h1>

<p>Now if you are able to both envision yourself, and continuously improve your understanding of yourself, you will now come to the impasse of how to proceed with life such that you can reach that envisioned content self. Between now and the future we all notice that there is no magical time leap machine we can take such that we can jump through the hoops of process and life. So we must take things step by step, which requires us to <em>create prioritizations in life</em>.</p>

<p>Fundamentally the act of prioritization is akin to the act of making decisions. For this I will direct you to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU2VOXH2PI4&amp;t=2s">Rational Reminder podcast episode #120 with Annie Duke</a>.</p>

<p>What I want to say though is that it is okay if you find your prioritizations to shift and change over time. Independently, envisioning and understanding yourself is already difficult, even more so when you start thinking of things and steps you would like to prioritize in order to achieve your goals and targets. The point is to be able to commit to the things that you have identified to be important, and if you realize eventually that they are not as important as you think they were, your vision for the future and the understanding you have for yourself will act as your lighthouse.</p>

<p>Many of us have heard of tales of regret from those whose lives have run out short. The least we want to be is be that someone that poured our resources for that extra dash of glittering junk in life, while missing the real beauty.</p>

<h1 id="h---hold-off-from-making-hasty-decision">H - Hold off from making hasty decision</h1>

<p>You may have heard of the tale of the GameStop mania in early 2021. Basically the story goes that GameStop’s stock experienced a massive increase in price, over a whopping 2000% growth from January 1st, 2021 of the year to its highest point on January 27th, 2021. Many people took a substantial amount of profit from this and those are the headlines you would like to see (or maybe not if you are feeling sour about it), but how many people <em>LOST</em> money?</p>

<p>I don’t know the global number, but here I’ll take a sample (and for sure a biased one to make a point). Based on <a href="https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/gme-data">Wealthsimple’s report</a> 67% of people that invested in the GameStop stock (GME) lost money. The holding period is an average of 4.5 days, not very long. So what does this say? Well, in general the average investor likely saw the craze, for whatever reason decided to jump in to the craze, and then seemingly as fast as they went in they got out of it. It’s good that many didn’t lose more than 1000, but financially it would’ve been better that they didn’t lose any. Ah but perhaps they were allured at the <em>potential</em> prospect</p>

<p>Meanwhile one of the earliest believers in the GME stock, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Gill">Keith Gill</a>, made millions out of this episode (and have not fully cashed out at the time of this writing), but he was holding the stock for a much longer period than 4.5 days. He held the stock since September 2019, whilst during that time the GME stock kept going lower AND he was making YouTube content talking about his position, making his thoughts and opinions public.</p>

<p>Against all odds AND viewing eyes, Keith held on and continued to have conviction. Yes his conviction may have turned out to be a bad result, but you cannot deny his conviction. At least in contrast to some of his peers with a holding period of 4.5 days, his decision definitely seems less hasty.</p>

<p>Now it is not necessarily the time horizon that I want to focus on, but the reasoning and believe you have over your decisions that I want to highlight. Remember, your future self and your self-understanding continues to be your lighthouse. Here’s another way to get my message across:</p>

<h1 id="o---organize-your-finances-and-be-on-top-of-it">O - Organize your finances and be on top of it</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>What you do not measure, you do not know</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is probably a pretty common saying you may have heard somewhere in your professional career or even the Internet. Leaving a side the origins of the statement and how accurate it is, it is undeniable that observability, data and understanding over that data is becoming more important in the digital age. Data is the new gold they say. So why not bring to your personal finance life?</p>

<p>I am an <a href="/blog/post/2020/12/20/budgeting-in-life">advocator for budgeting</a>. I am not a budgeting expert, but I try to budget and set myself expenditure targets. It helps me understand where my money is going, where I want it to go, and any discrepancy between reality and desire that may happen.</p>

<p>For a more universal topic, mayhaps you have heard tales of people who get swamped in their purchasing debt and are having trouble keeping a rein on it or improving the situation. And if you are Canadian you probably have heard of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0JI-rWPG3Y">hearsay speak about how high personal debt is in Canada</a>(and continue to grow).</p>

<p>While there are possibly some structural issues that people may be facing, it can also be useful to bring in specialized financial organization tools. Coupled with a vision for your future self, an understanding of oneself, commitment to prioritization and identification of what is important and holding off from making hasty decisions, these organization tools can be immensely powerful in paving the way for financial wellness.</p>

<p>Here are some tools that you can try to look into:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wealthica.com/">Wealthica</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://mint.intuit.com/">Mint.com</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.zero-basedbudget.com/">Zero based budgeting</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/">YNAB</a></li>
  <li>Good old Excel spreadsheets</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="r---run-from-comparison">R - Run from comparison</h1>

<p>Here’s another commonly heard phrase:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comparison is the thief of joy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I was small, from time to time I get compared by my parents to some other kid they knew. Luckily it wasn’t often for me, but when it did happen it always felt unnerving and discomforting. Even for the pettiest of things (at least in my head), such as who dresses nicer (definitely not me), it would still be a bit of a sting. A sting to my pride, confidence and yes, joy.</p>

<p>I do not dislike all kinds of comparisons. In fact, it is useful to be able to compare one thing over another, a lot of our decisions are a matter of extracting conclusions from comparisons. But there are certainly good AND bad comparisons. Remember how apples aren’t necessarily comparable to oranges? The same case applies often when we are compared against one another. A person’s situation may seem similar but contain vastly differing details. A comparison that does not really apply equal criteria and assumptions likewise is not a good comparison.</p>

<p>And when it comes to finances, it is also equally important to NOT make comparisons against others yourself. Here’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/may/11/outclassed-neighbors-income-happiness">an article</a> that mentions that social and wealth comparisons are detrimental for your psyche, and there are other research delving into the topic. It is the case irrespective of who is initiating the comparison.</p>

<p>I think in recent years we have started to learn the lesson from our exposure to social media, and we can apply the same wisdom there with our financial lives. Some people may be able to tolerate it, some may even revel in it. But it is probably best for most if not all of us, to run from it.</p>

<h1 id="i---involve-your-partner-in-the-discussion">I - Involve your partner in the discussion</h1>

<p>Did you know that marriage is costly? Here’s <a href="https://www.weddingwire.ca/wedding-ideas/how-much-does-the-average-wedding-cost-in-canada--c1677">an article from WeddingWire</a> that says the average Canadian wedding costs 29,450 CAD (maybe it has gone down during the pandemic though). But I contend that divorce is costlier. You get the mental and physical stress, arguments, fear, trauma, child care disputes, legal costs and also on top of it the financial costs.</p>

<p>This is not going to be a fair example for daily people like you and me but consider Jeff and Mackenzie Bezos’ divorce. Depending on how you see it, Mackenzie (Jeff) got (lost) <a href="https://www.weddingwire.ca/wedding-ideas/how-much-does-the-average-wedding-cost-in-canada--c1677">38 billion USD in Amazon stock</a>. Financially a big win for Mackenzie, but at the very least a dent into Jeff’s financial situation. As I’ve noted this is not a fair nor representative example of the average person, but it strikes an example of how costly financially a divorce can be. As your marriage (or even just dating) there are some assets that have been grown together between the you and your partner, a big one would be housing usually, which would somehow need to be divided amongst the both of you.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://www.insauga.com/many-canadian-couples-open-about-their-finances-survey">an article</a> that may be closer to home for young Canadian couples. It seems that financial communication has improved for these couples, yet still there are a significant percentage feeling like they are struggling to meet their financial goals. Communication is on aspect, but when I say “involve your partner” I mean so much more. It is about bringing your partner along with your journey of self-envisioning, self-understanding, self prioritization etc. Transforming the self into a process and activity of togetherness.</p>

<p>Let me try to inspire you with my own experience. Compared to me my partner isn’t at all interested in investments. I don’t try to force her into it but I explain to her about the things I do, and likewise she explains to me her thought process. While not much, but I managed to help her started with investing bit by bit, with what we think is suitable for her at this time. Everytime I think something good can be done for her investments I consult her, and I let her have the final say. Sometimes I want to do things faster, but she doesn’t. Sometimes I share investment material and discuss financial topics or scenarios with her, as much as she is willing to take. In doing all this I’ve made it clear to her that I want her to be financially ready and successful, regardless if I am there in her life or not. While we may be different in many ways, this is a common goal and journey that we are both working towards for each other.</p>

<h1 id="a---automate-where-possible">A - Automate where possible</h1>

<p>As a software engineer, automation naturally plays a big role in my life. I love to be able to automate the rote work I need to do day to day. Not only is it faster, if done well it can help bring a much needed simplicity to my activities. And the same case applies to finances, if not even more so.</p>

<p>Money has been a very emotionally related and charged topic in our culture. It has led to one of the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/financial-wellness-work/stress-impacts.html">greatest stressors in people’s lives</a>. Let alone making investments, people sometimes don’t know what to do to keep things afloat! Automation can’t help to start to fill all the holes caused by financial stress, but I believe it can greatly help people achieve consistency in implementing their goals and targets.</p>

<p>Technology such as <a href="https://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/personal/programs-services/bank-the-rest-personal-savings-program.html">Scotiabank’s Bank The Rest Program</a>, automatic paycheck deposit to savings account, pre-authorized contributions for investments, robo-advisors, spending tracking apps and tax software management, are just some examples of ways you can automate your financial life.</p>

<p>Will automation bring you the most optimal financial result? Theoretically, not always, especially since some of these automation technologies have a cost. However it definitely does help alleviate the taxing mental energy you would have otherwise required to invest in. And as human beings we are neither fully rational or have infinite capacity and resources to always consistently reach the optimal result. Worse, we are <a href="https://www.investmentnews.com/fundamentals-of-behavioral-finance-overconfidence-bias-197276">prone to be overconfident in our own ability</a>.</p>

<p>So why not let technology help you achieve speed, greater peace of mind and consistency? Those non-financial gains may very well outweigh whatever financial optimization you were trying to do, especially when you take into account what you should prioritize</p>

<h1 id="final-words">Final words</h1>

<p>The acronym <strong>EUPHORIA</strong> was created in the mindset and context of financial well-being. But I think it has room to be amended for other contexts. Additionally it doesn’t go through the gritty details and leaves out other important considerations. Some points may need to be adapted for your specific case (most easily visible in “<strong>I</strong>” if you don’t have a partner). But in general I believe it is a good and applicable recipe for financial (or other) well-being.</p>

I hope you, the reader, had the opportunity to take the time to unwind at the end of the year and embrace the new year to come. Usually at this time people would establish some kind of new year resolution (though I don’t usually do it myself). But after coming from such a turbulent year, at the very least for the majority of people, you might not be up for creating a new year resolution. Or perhaps you may be in a situation where your life and your surroundings is in such dissonance that you can’t make heads or tails of your life, let alone a new resolution.</p>

<p>If we were to be honest, the transition between the past year to the new year is simply a second difference. Within one second there isn’t much that necessarily change. Rather than a new year, shouldn’t it instead be called a continuing year? Well either way, the point is that things don’t just rapidly change in a split second. Considering the situation with COVID-19, though there are hopeful sentiments on vaccine rollout, there is a real chance that the next few months in the year would feel very similar to last year. Yet, things continuously change, especially in the macro levels of our life and surroundings. In the sea of changes (and undoubtedly uncertainty), it gets difficult to pinpoint any kind of target we can aim for. In this blog post I would like to talk about a framework to help you think about meaningful targets in your life.</p>

<h1 id="a-digression-to-probability">A digression to probability</h1>

<p>When working with probabilities you may have come across these set of symbols: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P(X|Y)</code> (or some variant of it). In more plain English it reads out as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the probability of X happening given that event Y happened</code>. For example, we can ask what is the probability that the cake I am baking is going to turn out well (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code>) given that I have followed the recipe to a tee (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y</code>), compared to simply asking what is the probability that the cake is going to turn out well (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P(X)</code> only).</p>

<p>Mathemathically, the calculation for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P(X)</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P(X|Y)</code> are vastly different and while there are more variables involved in the latter it can actually be easier to answer the latter than the former. Why is that so? Under the conditional probability you would be assuming that some event <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y</code> has happened, constraining a part of the myriad possibilities of events that can occur to a single possibility. Meanwhile when you try to answer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P(X)</code> you have to take into account those other possibilities <strong>AND</strong> also the possibilities of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But how does this relate to me you ask?</p>

<p>Let’s replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matters?</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">something</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y</code> with you. From <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P(X|Y)</code> we get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matters?(something|you)</code>, which now says <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">does this something matter given you</code>.</p>

<p>Behavioural economist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Thaler">Richard Thaler</a> has said in his works that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">People are not dumb. The world is hard</code>. I think we do tend to agree that yes the world can be hard and that we don’t want to be called dumb. More so than us being dumb, it certainly does feel like the world can be tremendously difficult to cope with, example: <em>COVID-19</em>. In a world where change is constant, it can get dizzyingly confusing and erratic to make sense of anything, let alone goals and targets.</p>

<p>In my recent <a href="/blog/post/2020/12/20/budgeting-in-life">post about budgeting</a> I talked a bit identifying goals that are important for you. Part of the steps required to identify the important goals in your life would be to ask yourself whether those goals matter. Of course, the question of what matters to you does not stop at goals either. But the world’s hard, we’ve agreed on that, and there are so many competing viewpoints and opinions out there. And I haven’t even mentioned social media, you know that place where you can easily fall in the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/articles/201711/the-comparison-trap">trap of comparisons</a> against people you don’t even know across the whole world. Against all these variables, how do you come to decide what matters to you?</p>

<p>Let’s go back to the transformed symbols I mentioned before, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matters?(something|you)</code>. Reading it in plain English we have “does this thing matter, given you”. Just like how calculating conditional probability let us assume certain variables, let’s start by constraining from the one variable that stays relatively well known - you. Yes you. Wouldn’t it be easier to think about the things that matter when we only consider it from our personal perspective, history, experience, knowledge, plans, past, situation etc. I’m not saying that it would be easy (look at all those parts about you I just quickly mentioned!), but it does seem easier to do.</p>

<p>While the world may move and change and be dizzyingly bizarre, the you that lives life second by second is likely to be majorly similar from each moment to moment, just like how the previous year transitions to the new year in a single second. Unconditionally you will remain similar to from before, and that non-conditionality I think will greatly help you to consider what truly matters for you. So my suggestion is to start thinking in the form of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matters?(something|you)</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matters?(something)</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I call this the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">what matters, given you</code> framework of thinking</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="focusing-on-the-simplicity">Focusing on the simplicity</h1>

<p>There’s a reason why I used conditional probability as my analogy. I want to emphasize on the words <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">given you</code>, which is intentionally used as a replacement for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for you</code>. The world’s complex, difficult, dynamic, rich and filled with other beings (human or otherwise). Obviously, the things that truly matter in the world and life are not just things that are related to you. In fact, some of those things that matter may be in complete contrast to what you may consider as important. But that’s why I framed the framework as I did.</p>

<p>I thought of the framework as a way to <strong>simplify the process of understanding what truly matters in life</strong>. I propose that we can start thinking about the things that matter in our life by identifying the thing that we are most likely to know best and least varied, ourselves. In truth, there will and should be further variables taken into account, but those are for the next steps. The things that matter will not just be decided by you, but it would definitely involve you. <strong>It is not ourselves that is the focus, but we can use ourselves as a starting point</strong></p>

<h1 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h1>

<p>Recently I have been thinking a lot about my own goals in life, which led me to ask several times the things that matter in my life. I realize, even more so than any previous time of my life, that such an endeavour is incredibly difficult. It also doesn’t help that society and our culture imposes certain expectations, overt or otherwise, on us. But in an effort to regain some sense of control over my thoughts and opinions, I have started to try tackling these large and grand questions in more simple building blocks. The framework of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">what matters, given you</code> is one of them that I have recently identified.</p>

As I look more into discovering my goals and how money interplays with it I’ve taken up budgeting much more seriously, and to some people’s surprise deriving joy out of it. I honestly think the few things that I’ve come to realize and went through is of such importance to me now that I truly believe it would hold importance for a great number of people too. So in this blog post I would like to talk about budgeting, and my thinking behind it</p>

<h1 id="what-is-a-budget">What is a budget?</h1>

<p>If you were to search for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=what+is+a+budget">“what is a budget?” on Google</a> you would get a number of definitions covering a range of ideas but they largely ring the same ideas: financial planning, income and expense estimation, planning to spend your money etc. My personal take is that <strong>budgeting is specifically the art and process of allocating resources towards a goal</strong>. In general the resources you can allocate through a budget can be anything, from something as concret as material resources to more abstract concepts such as time.</p>

<p>Notice how I did not add in an element of time to my description of a budget and this is deliberate. While budgeting is often cited as a way to manage money (and in general resources) in the future, in actual fact the act of managing future money requires management of money in the now. Additionally, the now is intricately linked to events and actions in the past. The baseline process can be visualized as the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify the goal in the future</li>
  <li>Plan the required resources for the goal</li>
  <li>Identify the gaps, if any, between required and present situation. Start to act or plan to act based identified gaps</li>
  <li>If actions can’t be taken, reflect on why and how it became to be so</li>
  <li>Re-adjust future goal or consider to allocate further resources to achieve the goal</li>
</ol>

<p>It is a cyclical and continuous process of estimation, towards the future, and reflection, of the past implemented in the present. As the needs and circumstances are identified it becomes more manageable to start implementing and taking the appropriate actions to realize the desired goal. Sometimes of course you may need to re-adjust the goals.</p>

<h1 id="the-purpose-of-allocation">The purpose of allocation</h1>

<p>The allocation of resources is simply one smaller part of budgeting, while the goal of budgeting is an even larger aspect. Without the goal, the allocation of resources would be meaningless. However, rather than focus on <strong>what</strong> the goal is, I would like to focus on <strong>how</strong> the goal is established. I think it is extremely important to start from your values when creating goals. Aligning your goals to your values, the things that you care deep down in your heart and mind, I think is extremely important. Not all goals should be of equal value to you.</p>

<p>For example, most people’s goal I would reckon is to grow up the career ladder which might not necessarily align with one’s values. Even though going up the career ladder may bring you greater income, something I’m sure many people will be happy to have, it may mean it comes with higher amounts of responsibility which leads to less family time. If family time is something of value to you, I would definitely say it would be prudent to reassess your goal. Is it something that you really want? It is a tremendous shame to see someone reach the goal that they have set, only to realize that the goal that they made for themselves were never the right destination to head towards.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Not all goals should be of equal importance to you</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Starting yourself with the question: “what is of value to me?” I believe will help you start with the right direction. Like a compass that helps ascertain the direction one is facing, your values will do the same for your goals. Once the direction is established, the range of destinations to get to will be clearer, and a clearer destination helps you to draw out the path to take.</p>

<h1 id="the-freedom-of-a-budget">The freedom of a budget</h1>

<p>One of my friend dislikes budgeting, particularly with regards to budgeting as a personal financial practice. Their reason is that budgeting feels stifling, they dislikes the fact that when you financially budget you put restraints on what and how much you can spend. I think this line of thinking is not uncommon. But I would like to persuade whoever thinks so. Remember that in how I define budgeting I specifically use the word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">allocation</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">goal</code>. The allocation of resources towards the accomplishment of a goal is not a restriction, on the contrary it is a deliberate conscious <strong>permission</strong> made by you so that you can put certain resources towards the goal. When you think of it this way, budgeting becomes the anti-thesis of a tool of restriction and instead it is a tool of <strong>freedom</strong>.</p>

<p>Let me give a simple example. One of my goals is simply that I would like to be entertained a.k.a I don’t want to be bored. I identified that the kinds of entertainment that I like requires paying a certain price. I ask myself - “well me, how much do I want to be entertained?” of which I answer with “I think $50 of this kind of entertainment should keep me reasonably entertained and I know that I am able to”. So I set up a financial budget of $50 per month for entertainment. Now, every month I am free to use that allocated $50 budget for my entertainment purposes however I want. When I do so, I don’t need to feel guilty or bad or worried or panic or anything that you might associate spending money frivolously with - because I have allowed myself to spend that much. If I do feel guilty, for whatever reason, that should be a signal that the budget that I have set was not appropriate for my values, which in turn is not appropriate for my goal.</p>

<p>I understand that by allocating only $50 in my example above a restriction is in place, set by myself, that I shouldn’t use more than $50 in a single month. Still, this restriction is one that I was freely able to make after considering my goals and values along with my current situation. The explicit process of identifying my goals and values and my current situation frees me up to make a conscious and informed decision that aligns both with the present situation and the future. Moreover, now you have freed up the rest of your resources for other goals that you want to strive for.</p>

<h1 id="taking-budgeting-forward">Taking budgeting forward</h1>

<p>This year has been quite an overhaul on my approach towards budgeting. Before this year though I have target goals, I never enacted a budget as a way to help realize those goals in actuality. Moreover, I did not consider whether how I use my resources, predominantly time and money, aligns with not only my goals but also more importantly my values. Now that I have taken budgeting more seriously and consider how its implications I don’t see myself letting it go. If you read this far, I truly thank you for your time and allowing yourself to read this blog post. I hope it was a good use of your time resource and helped you achieve your goals.</p>]]></content><author><name>btruhand</name><email>btruhand@gmail.com</email></author><category term="life" /><category term="finance" /><category term="planning" /><category term="goals and values" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exploring what a budget is and what it means to have one]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/images/exploding_rubicks.gif" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/images/exploding_rubicks.gif" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
