I was certain of taking an
NLP (natural language processing) course and only need to take one more elective course besides that. The choice was between &lt;a href=&quot;https://coursys.sfu.ca/2020sp-cmpt-727-g1/pages/&quot;&gt;CMPT 727 - Statistical Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2020/spring/cmns/815/g100&quot;&gt;CMNS 815 - Social Construction of Communication Technologies&lt;/a&gt;. CMPT 727 would clearly complement the whole degree itself and would even go hand in hand with NLP, while CMNS 815 may be argued as more loosely tied to the degree and my overall career path. But I have made a similar decision before in my undergraduate years, between taking statistics or philosophy as my minor. I chose the uncommon philosophy as my choice, and in the same fate spirit as I did before I choise CMNS 815 as my last elective course to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My decision to take philosophy as my undergraduate minor were due to both my interest and benefits. With machine learning and data science on the rise, many would
probably I missed out on the opportunity as statistical capabilities would help me transition with more ease to such roles. Personally I disagree, firstly because
statistics is not something I’m particularly fond of learning (it is one of the more difficult areas of mathematics for me to get a handle on), and secondly
I felt that zoning in on a technical field would make me too technically inclined. I prefer to be more balanced and rounded in both discipline and worldview.
These same reasons apply when I chose CMNS 815 over CMPT 727. I knew that I am neither greatly interested in statistics or machine learning (I prefer building and
designing software) and that CMNS 815 would help me see technology in a broder social context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CMNS 815 in a nutshell was examining how technologies not just impact, but play a role in the shaping of society, cultures and worldviews. The technologies discussed
were not constraint to the technologies we are so wary of these days such as social media, surveillance cameras, computers but also to clocks, institutions, language
and many more things that in this day and age we would not immediately associate with the word “technology”. Perhaps it is better to replace “technology” with the term
“tools of life” to capture the broad sense of technology covered. But the course isn’t about isolating particular social phenomena or impact to a particular technology,
but it attempted to use particular case studies of technology to bring about understanding and appreciation of how technology &lt;em&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; impact society. Example of topics
include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;distributed agency, realizing objects (technologies) can express a form of choice and greatly affect our own sense of agency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the subtle yet powerful classifications made by technologies and their designers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the encoding of humanity in something that is not human, such as data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;importance and power of language and metaphors in how we think of the world including technologies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ethics and how technologists grapple with ethical needs and perceived moral stances&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;shaping behaviour through technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and many more…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-i-value-it-so-much&quot;&gt;Why I value it so much&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from my own interests the professor Sun Ha Hong who teched the course was clearly keen, knowledgeable and empathetic. Combined with my own personal interests,
it made the class much more enjoyable. The small class size (7 people in total) was also beneficial as thre were a lot of opportunities, designed or ad-hoc, to engage
with students and exchange pointers. Above all however is the diversity of topics, while also maintaining an approachable depth so as to not just be a skim of topics.
As a professional working in software, there are seldom any encouragement or endorsed professional opportunity to expand insights beyond the usual technical realm.
Having guidance in the vast discourse of social topics helps me expand my understanding and appreciation in a manageable way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a software engineer I wanted to be better at wrestling and engaging with the social consequences of my own work and the profession itself. I came to CMNS 815 with
that hope, and I felt it did better prepare me for future challenges. Certainly, the spotlights given by media these days pressured me to thinking that I should be
able to balance the ethical and social good with monetary results. But I am also of the conviction that positively navigating the social dilemmas of our creation
should be a nurtured and expected ability of software engineers. This course helped me forward to realize that conviction in my own professional life. Sure, the
chances of being asked about the social issues of technology in an interview will likely not crop up. Open discussion of them might not even happen reasonably often,
and my colleagues may show little interest. However, I see this knowledge and experience as my little edge over others, and I can proudly say that I am not afraid to
reflect on the muddy social issues of the software I had built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a culmination of what I had learnt I wrote a paper on cryptocurrency and trust (maybe I will cover it in some future time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-recommendation-to-you&quot;&gt;My recommendation to you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are an SFU student and you can afford to take this course, take this course. If you happen to find a similar course somewhere else take it. I’m obviously biased,
and well aware that such my fellow software engineers (or perhaps technologists in general) are not really inclined to take such courses. I understand, between
learning something that can have immediate clear gains to your professional and personal life (learning some new language) vs a course like CMNS 815, many would choose
the former. Yet I can’t help to recommend this course least because of the knowledge and experience I had gained, and more so due to how I throughly enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>btruhand</name><email>btruhand@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">For my final term at SFU for the Big Data specialization masters program I was at a decision junction between several courses I can take.

Like now, back then I had the same thought of “hey why not start blogging, it will be good for experience and maybe
it will be helpful for people”. But then I stopped, and here I am again trying to make blog posts. One time I had an interview for a job and the interviewee asked me
what do in my personal time to which I said I &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to blog, which the interviewee of course asked “why did you stop?” It was a hard question to answer on the spot,
because I knew that the truthful answer does not put me in a good spotlight. The reasons why I stopped blogging was…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;Lazy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lazy. I felt the need to keep making posts and coming up with things to talk about (as if I was getting any readership, I didn’t even promote or manage my blog’s
SEO). That feeling of needing to make posts in a consistent basis, if not for the views at least for self-improvement, was honestly not fun to do. And it created
this feeling of pressure to do it, like a dreaded homework that you keep procastinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scared&quot;&gt;Scared&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was scared. Even though I knew I wasn’t necessarily getting any readership (I didn’t set up analytics but most probably did not), I was scared at putting my thoughts
in the public domain. I was scared if the presentation was good enough, are the words I chose appropriate, is my post controversial, is it relatable etc. etc. I have
a knack for overthinking and finding different possibilities, and surely I did and it kind of overwhelmed me funnily enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-different-now&quot;&gt;What’s different now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only recently entertained the idea of blogging again. It’s not to kill time during the COVID-19 pandemic but because I still do have desires to express my thoughts
in some concrete manner, which blogging helps with. It’s also a way for me to have my own little personal “product” that I can work on bit by bit. So there is both
personal and professional reasons to why I am restarting blogging. To help overcome the reasons why I stopped blogging, here are several things I want to stick to as
much as possible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not hoping to gain viewership. I want to make this blog grow for now for myself and I don’t want to be caught up on “advertising”, which also includes feeling forced
to make posts in a consistent timeframe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focusing on creating honest but quality written work. I want to emphasize on the honesty part first, and then worry about presentation and stringent professionalism
second&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enjoy it more! Honestly, I need to enjoy my own creative work more and enjoy the process of it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be sticking my best to these guidelines&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>btruhand</name><email>btruhand@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">The first time I tried blogging was back in 2017.

&lt;figcaption&gt;Thinking, thinking, thinking, always thinking&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago I read the following article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/a-blueprint-for-coexistence-with-artificial-intelligence/&quot;&gt;AI and jobs&lt;/a&gt;
. The author, Mr. Kai-Fu Lee goes back a bit telling his tale, a near death experience, continued with regret and then resolving it into a vision for the current
and upcoming age of AI. In the article he argued that in order for us to co-exist (take not he didn’t say &lt;em&gt;to win&lt;/em&gt;) with AI is for us to create avenues in life    , particularly jobs that takes advantage and relies on our humanity. The specific quality which he propose to be a solution to the job-market-wrecking-AI problem
is &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;. Mr. Lee did mention other qualities which we often think are intrinsically tied to what makes us humans, but the main thing is love. 
Mr. Lee’s article then made me thinking about values and AI, and I’ve thought of several things. So let’s continue and read them below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-value-of-data&quot;&gt;The value of data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have heard by now the wise words “Knowledge is power” (to which I agree). And you may have heard “Data is the new oil”, that is data is the basis of our
current age, just like oil was in the 18th century. But of course humanity has amassed knowledge and data for so many years, past decades and centuries, though they
do say most of our amassed data has been created in the past few years. You get the idea though, we’ve been gathering data for many years now and now with the
advancement of technology the data we have stacked up and gathered that have been left to dust previously are being picked up and consumed. We feed our computers,
servers, models with data and create products and services out of them. Where previously data was just lying there seemingly dead without much use (aside for a
select group of entities, like Google which really have the resources and expertise), now our world is inundated with data and so called &lt;i&gt;data-driven decision&lt;/i&gt;.
Through technology we have managed to extract and find value in data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;extending-the-value-of-data-with-ai&quot;&gt;Extending the value of data with AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there’s AI, which like Mr. Lee said, really is another piece of technology that consumes and tries to get value out of our data. But it not only extracts
value out of data, AI also extrapolates value out of our data. It creates models, decisions, predictions, generalizations out of our data and use them on
complex subjects it may have never seen and which we like to solve or get better at. AI enables things like self-driving cars, better more relevant ads, AlphaGo
possible. To add to that, with current advances in technology and research AI has really taken off not just in complexity but also speed and availability. AI
has taken the value of data a step further by enabling the ability to create services and products that really wouldn’t have been able to take off without it
(think self-driving cars). Though at the same time it has made several of our jobs redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;extending-the-value-of-ai&quot;&gt;Extending the value of AI?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that AI has given us so much value, where do we go from here on? How do we keep ourselves relevant in a world where technology and AI has been able to eke out
value out of data, the resource that is believed to be most crucial in our age, better (arguably) and faster (definitely) than we ourselves can? Mr. Lee’s proposed
solution is more akin to complementing that rather than extending on it. Rather than trying to come up with a way in which we can possibly do better than AI, or
add something to AI’s results which it cannot do itself, to him it is better to to work alongside AI and let us be complemented and also to complement it with our
inherent humanistic qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem-is&quot;&gt;The problem is…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea itself is fine in my opinion, but the execution may not be so simple. I’m pretty sure there are many more people who are far more qualified than me
to talk about AI and how to solve the possibility of us being runover by AI. But despite the many influential and capable people out there it seems the fear and
worry has not gone away and no actual implemented solution is on the way. At best it’s because the problem is inherently hard to formulate and to solve in a way
that can satisfy the vast majority of our world. At worst… it’s because we really don’t know think there are significant value we can gain from our inherent
humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay I doubt it’s as bad as I purport, but I do think the thought has some merit. At the very least I do think we don’t give enough objective and appreciation
to our humanistic qualities. For example, I’m sure most if not all of us would agree that a great and caring parent goes a long way in the upbringing of a child and
their future. A child that is brought up well and with great care probably has less risks to incur mental health problems which may be related to their environment.
So those kids in the future can be healthier, and less cost is needed to maintain his or her mental health. A great parent also seems likely to enable their child
to attain greater heights, and thus higher social contribution in the future. These are all valuable things for us and our society and have direct or indirect
consequence to our economy, but I’m not aware of any widespread economic measurement that takes into account quality of parenthood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other humanistic qualities which I am sure we do value in our life, but are not given it’s due appreciation and value in an objective manner.
Whether that objective quantification or assessment is in terms of monetary value, or recognition, or something else, I do think we are lacking in that aspect.
This is a problem that is not inherent in AI but in us, in how we see, value and think of life, of ourselves. If we are to complement the value of our AI with
value inherent in us, then we must be able to value our human capabilities and existence in ourselves and in others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Mr. Lee’s blueprint, though barebones, is something agreeable. Rather than battling our way through data and AI’s inherent ability to qucikly and accurately
derive value out of data we should strive to look into ourselves ways in which we can bring about value through our own nature. As AI achieves feats which
we have previously only associated with humans we would need to branch out to other areas, whether to compete or to co-exist with AI. But branching out would also
entail our desire and ability to find value in those areas, a problem which I think we, as humans and society, need to solve by ourselves and re-align
our values.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>btruhand</name><email>btruhand@gmail.com</email></author><category term="[&quot;old-post&quot;, &quot;AI&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Thinking, thinking, thinking, always thinking</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Balance in life</title><link href="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2017/04/04/balance-in-life" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Balance in life" /><published>2017-04-04T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-04-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2017/04/04/balance-in-life</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2017/04/04/balance-in-life">&lt;p&gt;Around 1 year and a month ago I started working in Japan. Perhaps many of you have heard on the harsh conditions of long working hours in Japan and incidents of
suicide by death and other such depressing stories. Being faced with such a possibility I put myself in a staunch position to maintain a clear distinction between personal
and work life and not to let one or the other, particularly the work aspect, negatively impact on the other. And of course this is what many of us refer to as work-life
balance, maintaining an equilibrium between work and personal life. But there’s more to this than simply about work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After establishing my stance on my work-life balance, I started to think about all kinds of balance in life, having realized how important it is in general in our lives.
As an example, during people’s daily work, we  have a stack of to-do list everyday and sometimes I would need to find the balance between, in
terms of time spent, working on task A compared to all other tasks. As another example, when we buy products many of us would weight in between the price vs value of
a service or good. Yet in another example we talk about maintaining a balanced diet for our health. It would seem that balance is quite prevalent in our life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick skim of balance led me to the believe that balance is important and prevalent in our life, which leads me to the question: how well are we at creating, identifying
and maintaining balance? I’m asking this not so much on the perspective of human’s innate ability but more so on our surroundings. A lot of our time is spent in improving ourselves
or just doing a small set of core activities, and there are advices to continue doing so. Just as an example, there’s quite a lot of advices to maintain focus in order to get into
an Ivy League school, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.prepscholar.com/how-to-get-into-harvard-and-the-ivy-league-by-a-harvard-alum&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-get-into-an-Ivy-League-college/answer/Arvin-Chang?srid=7d08&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
On the other hand many of us grew up in an environment in school that exposed us to all kinds of activities by having us take a diverse set of subjects in 12 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet again at work and at other times we are asked to focus and present the main points, while in the process of focusing on the main points we are asked to consider alternatives,
balancing our view points. We’re told to find and focus on the things and people that matter, at the same time we’re told by articles to travel and explore and find something new to do,
to be adventurous. People want us to be nice, but at the same time we shouldn’t make ourselves exposed to danger. In showing these examples I think there is one thing that we can consider:
we have a love with balance and at the same time we have a love in focus. And between our love for focus and our love for balance, we have the meta question of how do we balance between the two?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might not have a universal answer to the question, but I do believe that a possible answer is that that each of us not only have a common sense of balance but also a personal
sense. My sense of work-life balance is most likely not the same as Elon Musk, who just made another venture into a brain-computer company and still managing 3 other companies. Your sense
of good to safety balance is probably not the same as mine as people have different levels of good they are comfortable in displaying. What I think is balanced may not necessarily be
what you think is balanced. A lot of it really comes down to identifying and being aware of personal value and adjusting as needed. It’s more of a part of the art of living than it is
the science of living. That’s my take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certainly a lot of talk about focus, and a lot of talk about balance, and sometimes one will prevail over another out of necessity but there are also times we would need to
balance between the two. In between the myriad of advices for such situations I just think there is little talk in reconciling the two. Having being so conscious on balancing my own life
made me realize the relevance of it and how it is so intrinsic to our lives, because if you go over some of the examples I gave a lot of balancing we do is for the sake of maximizing
or minimizing results, something we humans put a lot of attention into.  The sense of balance you have now may not be the best it can be, but I think if only we can identify them we put
ourselves in a better position to create a balanced life by simply being aware of it. Cheers to a personally balanced life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>btruhand</name><email>btruhand@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Around 1 year and a month ago I started working in Japan.

&lt;p&gt;Getting started with this website’s blog, I would really like to quickly go over the journey that I’ve went through until now.
Since I would be sharing my opinions and thoughts quite often I hope this first post will be able to act as a context of
how I came to form my thoughts. Also, I think it’s a nice way for me to reach out to you readers personally, to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;indonesia&quot;&gt;Indonesia&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that Indonesia is my home country it definitely served as an important foundation in my life. Particularly my education.
Before starting elementary school I went to a pre-school, that according to my mum deemed me unfit to continue to elementary
school. Long story short, my parents moved me to another school out of frustration. And I’m glad to have been moved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The school that I moved to had a complete elementary to high school education. Yes, I was in the same school for 12 years. For 12 years
I was with more or less the same people, a few became quite good friends of mine. Reflecting back it was very stable times, things were
very predictable, I had friends around me and support of my family. This stability and ease really enabled me to focus on my education.
In this sense I was very privileged, and I agree, I was. Not to mention the school had a good International Baccalaureate program,
a program that I feel emulated university life quite well. It had a good portion of projects, essays, lab reports etc.
that mattered to the final decision along with a final exam. Very similar to undergraduate education these days. What I loved most learning
in IB was that it didn’t settle down on a particular world view. It’s curriculum was set up with an emphasis on finding out “how”
and “why” not just “what”. So the curriculum never fixated itself to a particular context but instead encouraged exploration of multiple contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of focus, though I say I was able to focus in my education, as a child I was actually unable to focus. My mum enrolled me to Kumon, a math after-school
program in order for me to be able to sit down, study and focus (I was a very hyperactive kid she said). Fortunately my fondness of math
started from here, and though I may have liked math without Kumon I don’t think I would be so into it without it. Kumon did work and helped me
focus at my tasks at hand, though perhaps unfortunately now I’m much more fond of just sitting and thinking instead of moving around doing physical
exercise. You gain some, you lose some I suppose. Oh and as trivia I was known as the math whiz-kid earning myself the title “walking calculator”.
It didn’t make me look cooler though, but being geeky and nerdy is also great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;canada&quot;&gt;Canada&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all I have to say, my time in Canada has undoubtedly been the best time of my life. It’s the time that I really got to see the world
for myself and a time of growth. I enjoyed the diversity of Canada, it’s friendly people and it’s tendency to be open-minded and welcoming.
Though I didn’t really enjoy the winter-ish spring, teenage-angst weather, goose spawns, oh and less than subpar public transport (sorry have been
pampered by Japan’s public transport here). But hey, again, you lose some you gain some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a recap I went to Canada to pursue my computer science degree. And you may wonder why Canada and the answer is quite simple, because my elder
brother and sister both went to Canada for their undergraduate studies. Actually they went at a much earlier age and they started school in Canada
ever since their high school, and at that time I was 7 years old. My brother and sister going to Canada when I was at such a young age also
allowed me to develop in peculiar ways, but I will save it perhaps for another time. But yes, essentially my parents had a sense of familiarity
with Canada so we chose Canada. As for why not Indonesia, it was primarily because the IB program was aimed for international education and it would
have been a shame I thought to settle down in Indonesia and not try to cultivate that international mindset elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, you might now be thinking why computer science? And for that question… to this date I still don’t know exactly why. I remember very clearly
there was a day that my brother asked me “so why are you choosing computer science?” to which I gave the trite answer “I feel like I can help change
the world with it”. Not very original, and wasn’t very sure either back then. Though I do like math and computer science is a part of mathematics I’ve never
had any exposure to it. The best that I know was something along the lines “it involves programming”. And I was right, but it was certainly much more than
that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first term in university I thought to myself “maybe I chose the wrong major…”. Computer science was difficult, it was by far the most difficult
subject/field I have ever studied. And it was most likely a combination of first time living alone and first time faced with such a difficult subject
that made me question my decision. It was not as if I was getting bad marks, but for every single assignment I would take at least 10 hours
to complete it, and in the end my grades were just “fine”. It was that shocked feeling I suppose of not being able to achieve my usual standard
despite great efforts that really threw me off. Nevertheless it was a much needed experience since then I understood how much more there is for me
to work on and managing my ego. I’m certainly glad to have stuck with computer science since now I absolutely love it, and really encourage others
to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one thing that I definitely regret while I was in Canada and that is not being able to take University of Waterloo’s famous co-op program.
I actually applied for it but was not accepted. And I tried applying for it in my second term, which was the last term a currently enrolled
student can try applying for co-op, and again I failed. I regret it mostly because I didn’t get a Canadian working experience and co-op would have
helped me immensely with that. I would have most likely stayed in Canada or try for US if I had. On the flip side it enabled me to really focus on
my studies. In the end I chose to sprint through university thinking that the faster I finish university, the faster I can start working. In addition,
since many people were taking co-op which prolongs the time it takes to finish their studies, most of my classmetes were older than me, giving me
a chance to connect with a variety of people. Again give and take, and if I were to be given a chance to redo it all over again… I would still choose
to try for coop HAHAHA, but all in all things worked out for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;japan&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m in Japan and lo and behold, the reason why I am now in Japan is not very different from why I was in Canada: &lt;b&gt;by chance I am now here&lt;/b&gt;.
Summer 2015 was supposed to be my last term in university, I was one term away from completing a total of eight terms. At that time I’ve only taken
one long term break during winter 2014 when I interned in a digital marketing agency. I was a bit proud of it, I thought I could finish
the whole of university with only one term break under my belt, I guess just from a sense of feeling I worked hard. However my brother was going to
get married in August 2015, right around exam season and so I decided it was best to postpone my final term. It was at this time that I applied for
my current job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest I didn’t know at all about Rakuten, Inc. By chance I saw a post from UW’s computer science facebook group information about company
in Japan was hiring and so I applied considering I had the time to. Somehow or another I was accepted. I say “somehow” because really I didn’t even
expect to get an interview considering how poorly I thought I performed in the initial coding test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no experience in Japan and moving would be (and is) a very challenging shift for me. Though precisely because of that I took the offer, for the
prospect of personal growth and career growth thinking and hoping that the experience would enable me to shape a brighter path up ahead. I would
most likely post about my time and impressions in Japan at another time, but so far it has been turning out quite well with some less-than-ideal
moments, to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;and-now-here-i-am&quot;&gt;And now here I am…&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Settling down a bit going through the motions of day to day life, living out a life this time as a part of the workforce, as a foreigner and that guy
that smiles randomly in the streets. I hope this post was able to give you some insight to what kind of person I may be, whatever it is. Going
forward may this post serve as a reminder of the context of upbringing, education life, personal interactions and such that I have went through
so that my blog posts are more easily digested in mind and heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do want to go somewhere else, Japan in my mind is not the place I would want to settle in, I just don’t know where yet. Most likely candidate right now
would be to go back to Canada, catch up with friends, and finally get that Canadian experience. But things are still up in the air and plus by the time
of this writing it has only been a year or so I’m in Japan. Perhaps the next place I go to will be another ‘by chance’ moment, I think my life is filled
with a lot of those by now. Wherever I’m going I hope you can join me in the journey.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>btruhand</name><email>btruhand@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Intro Getting started with this website’s blog, I would really like to quickly go over the journey that I’ve went through until now. Since I would be sharing my opinions and thoughts quite often I hope this first post will be able to act as a context of how I came to form my thoughts. Also, I think it’s a nice way for me to reach out to you readers personally, to a certain extent.</summary></entry></feed>
