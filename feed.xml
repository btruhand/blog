As I look more into discovering my goals and how money interplays with it I’ve taken up budgeting much more seriously, and to some people’s surprise deriving joy out of it. I honestly think the few things that I’ve come to realize and went through is of such importance to me now that I truly believe it would hold importance for a great number of people too. So in this blog post I would like to talk about budgeting, and my thinking behind it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-a-budget&quot;&gt;What is a budget?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were to search for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;amp;q=what+is+a+budget&quot;&gt;“what is a budget?” on Google&lt;/a&gt; you would get a number of definitions covering a range of ideas but they largely ring the same ideas: financial planning, income and expense estimation, planning to spend your money etc. My personal take is that &lt;strong&gt;budgeting is specifically the art and process of allocating resources towards a goal&lt;/strong&gt;. In general the resources you can allocate through a budget can be anything, from something as concret as material resources to more abstract concepts such as time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how I did not add in an element of time to my description of a budget and this is deliberate. While budgeting is often cited as a way to manage money (and in general resources) in the future, in actual fact the act of managing future money requires management of money in the now. Additionally, the now is intricately linked to events and actions in the past. The baseline process can be visualized as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify the goal in the future&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plan the required resources for the goal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify the gaps, if any, between required and present situation. Start to act or plan to act based identified gaps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If actions can’t be taken, reflect on why and how it became to be so&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-adjust future goal or consider to allocate further resources to achieve the goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a cyclical and continuous process of estimation, towards the future, and reflection, of the past implemented in the present. As the needs and circumstances are identified it becomes more manageable to start implementing and taking the appropriate actions to realize the desired goal. Sometimes of course you may need to re-adjust the goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-purpose-of-allocation&quot;&gt;The purpose of allocation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The allocation of resources is simply one smaller part of budgeting, while the goal of budgeting is an even larger aspect. Without the goal, the allocation of resources would be meaningless. However, rather than focus on &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; the goal is, I would like to focus on &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; the goal is established. I think it is extremely important to start from your values when creating goals. Aligning your goals to your values, the things that you care deep down in your heart and mind, I think is extremely important. Not all goals should be of equal value to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, most people’s goal I would reckon is to grow up the career ladder which might not necessarily align with one’s values. Even though going up the career ladder may bring you greater income, something I’m sure many people will be happy to have, it may mean it comes with higher amounts of responsibility which leads to less family time. If family time is something of value to you, I would definitely say it would be prudent to reassess your goal. Is it something that you really want? It is a tremendous shame to see someone reach the goal that they have set, only to realize that the goal that they made for themselves were never the right destination to head towards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not all goals should be of equal importance to you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting yourself with the question: “what is of value to me?” I believe will help you start with the right direction. Like a compass that helps ascertain the direction one is facing, your values will do the same for your goals. Once the direction is established, the range of destinations to get to will be clearer, and a clearer destination helps you to draw out the path to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-freedom-of-a-budget&quot;&gt;The freedom of a budget&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my friend dislikes budgeting, particularly with regards to budgeting as a personal financial practice. Their reason is that budgeting feels stifling, they dislikes the fact that when you financially budget you put restraints on what and how much you can spend. I think this line of thinking is not uncommon. But I would like to persuade whoever thinks so. Remember that in how I define budgeting I specifically use the word &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;allocation&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;goal&lt;/code&gt;. The allocation of resources towards the accomplishment of a goal is not a restriction, on the contrary it is a deliberate conscious &lt;strong&gt;permission&lt;/strong&gt; made by you so that you can put certain resources towards the goal. When you think of it this way, budgeting becomes the anti-thesis of a tool of restriction and instead it is a tool of &lt;strong&gt;freedom&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me give a simple example. One of my goals is simply that I would like to be entertained a.k.a I don’t want to be bored. I identified that the kinds of entertainment that I like requires paying a certain price. I ask myself - “well me, how much do I want to be entertained?” of which I answer with “I think $50 of this kind of entertainment should keep me reasonably entertained and I know that I am able to”. So I set up a financial budget of $50 per month for entertainment. Now, every month I am free to use that allocated $50 budget for my entertainment purposes however I want. When I do so, I don’t need to feel guilty or bad or worried or panic or anything that you might associate spending money frivolously with - because I have allowed myself to spend that much. If I do feel guilty, for whatever reason, that should be a signal that the budget that I have set was not appropriate for my values, which in turn is not appropriate for my goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that by allocating only $50 in my example above a restriction is in place, set by myself, that I shouldn’t use more than $50 in a single month. Still, this restriction is one that I was freely able to make after considering my goals and values along with my current situation. The explicit process of identifying my goals and values and my current situation frees me up to make a conscious and informed decision that aligns both with the present situation and the future. Moreover, now you have freed up the rest of your resources for other goals that you want to strive for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;taking-budgeting-forward&quot;&gt;Taking budgeting forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year has been quite an overhaul on my approach towards budgeting. Before this year though I have target goals, I never enacted a budget as a way to help realize those goals in actuality. Moreover, I did not consider whether how I use my resources, predominantly time and money, aligns with not only my goals but also more importantly my values. Now that I have taken budgeting more seriously and consider how its implications I don’t see myself letting it go. If you read this far, I truly thank you for your time and allowing yourself to read this blog post. I hope it was a good use of your time resource and helped you achieve your goals.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>btruhand</name><email>btruhand@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">This year I’ve taken up more interest in personal finance, and starting to really think about longer term goals (5 to 10 years ahead for example) and thinking about the costs those goals would entail.

Now job search is not something I look forward to and doing it in a pandemic does not make me more enthusiastic. But due to personal reasons my decision to move to a new job was already set in stone pandemic or otherwise. I am sure I am not the only one that have been doing job searches during these hard times, so I feel my experience may bring some value to those that want to or still are job searching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;background-and-timeline&quot;&gt;Background and timeline&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For background I was applying software/data engineering jobs in Toronto, Canada when I was still in Vancouver, Canada. I finished my Masters program on early April and I was targeting for a job position by end of August, which is when I planned to move to Toronto. During my job search I was working as a software engineer for a company that knows about my moving plans. Due to situation I was mostly mass applying to all kinds of software engineering jobs, though my specialty and expertise lies in backend engineering. Here is my job search timeline:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Started applying for jobs mid April to early May and then stopped because of a combination of a lack of motivation, jobs that match my preferences and feeling that it was a bit too far from August.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restarted looking for jobs early June, this continued up to the third week of August. Applied almost daily, 1 to 3 applications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By early july only a handful (around 5) of recruiters/companies have contacted me back. Phone call interviews did not go well. Decided to introspect what kind of jobs I really want and the value I can bring forth as an engineer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In late July got a phone call interview for a node.js developer position. Flunked that one, used it as an opportunity to learn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Got a phone interview for my current company in early August, and managed to get past. Interview with management a week after, used the time to read up on company further and studied several materials&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Passed interview with management and recruiter was able to put me for the technical interview with the team on the next day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technical interview went well, but with some hiccups. Ended with an offer that I took&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this blog post will be structured following the timeline I laid out above as each one has a different story to tell. Since it’s quite long I will break the blog post to two parts. Link for the second part will be added on later&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;timeline-1&quot;&gt;Timeline #1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid April I was just finishing up my masters studies. Not wanting to waste time I immediately started to look for job openings. I decided to change some of the formatting of my resume to what I think is cleaner and better aligned to my goal of finding a software engineering job. I primarily used Indeed and LinkedIn for my job search and my searches were honed in to a full time job for software/data engineering positions. I’ve never really worked on a conctractual basis so I wasn’t sure if I would like that, and with the pandemic going on I wanted to find something that would be long lasting for a sense of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn’t much that happened during this period. I immediately noticed that many job positions were looking for more of a full-stack engineer and I really wanted to focus on backend. But since I do have a bit of frontend understanding (nothing modern or advanced) I soon decided to just apply to those that demanded full-stack capabilities, and even some that are purely frontend. Surely it is better to try and apply rather than not at all (right?). Of course, simply increasing the breadth of my applications did not mean it generated any positive results. Most of the applications I made were not receiving any replies, and if they were replied it was a rejection. Some of the reasons I came up for myself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The employers weren’t interested in my application (this is likely the case for various reasons)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was quite open in stating that I was looking for a job starting at the soonest on August/September and perhaps it didn’t fit with the employers timeframe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some wild theory that companies weren’t actually looking to hire but just scouting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I never really know the reason, it did leave me feeling a bit dejected. Nearing May, I got a phone call from the employer that I worked for during my co-op  wondering if I can come to help them on their projects. I took the offer and became busy with work and left job search on the side thinking that it may be better to try and apply another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;timeline-2&quot;&gt;Timeline #2&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May most of my time was taken up by work and just spending my off-time relaxing by picking up some Switch games that I have neglected. When June arrived I noticed that I haven’t been looking for jobs ever since I stopped. There is only 3 months left until I move to Toronto and that felt too close comfort. It’s actually a bit funny thinking back on how a month’s difference makes my perception of time availability turn 180 degrees, from “I have time” to “I don’t have time”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to improve from my previous attempts at applications I decided to look back to my resume and cover letter once more. Some of the things that I did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I noticed some inconsistencies in formatting and some grammatical improvements to be made in my resume&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I put more emphasis on the job experiences that I wanted to highlight and be proud of by reordering them and using active words&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I created several copies of my resume, only differing in the job title that I wanted to present myself as depending on the application&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I decided to create a standard cover letter resume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would think that one of the things that I would have done was to have a connection review my resume in the list above, but as you there is no mention of it. Why? The reason is simple, I was too afraid to ask it to be critiqued by another set of eyes. Honestly, I should have sought someone to critique it for me, but I was simply too scared at the thought of being shot down, getting told that what I have won’t impress anyone and overall deflating my confidence and spirit. Deep down I know I have some issues with imposter syndrome, and honestly sometimes I do believe that I am incapable. Some time in the future I would probably write another blog post about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;timeline-3&quot;&gt;Timeline #3&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job search did not go well. The number of applications that resulted into responses can be counted on one hand, while in total I probably applied to at least 50 applications (1 - 3 applications per day, at least 5 days per week). The ratio of “success”, success here simply getting a reply, is less than 1-to-10, yikes. Furthermore, I was sure not able to impress recruiters in my phone interviews. At some moments I did think that maybe it was all because of COVID19 and the job search climate. But I decided that even if that was the case, &lt;strong&gt;it was something that I can’t control&lt;/strong&gt;. No matter how much I groan, my groaning would not lead to the outcome I desire, getting a job. So I further expanded my effort to improve my application process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I challenged myself to answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What kind of job I really want? Does industry matter?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What responsibilities would I best be able to serve in? What technologies that I know that can benefit the company I apply to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answering the two questions above I decided to stop applying to frontend-heavy jobs. I would still apply to a full stack positions, but mostly those that are more backend oriented. While this is doubling down on a specific engineering area, it is really where I want to be and where I feel I can contribute best as an employee. With that in mind I reviewed my resume and cover letter once more to change how I present myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My most extensive work experience were with messaging/event-driven and data streaming oriented systems which coincidentally I enjoyed and was partly the reason to why I took a masters program. Therefore I made those experiences my main highlight in both my resume and cover letter. There isn’t many applications that directly mention such systems, but I wanted to put myself forward not as an all-rounder programmer that has no specialty. I wanted to be seen as someone that has a specialty but also possessing a broad range of skills. The next major experience that I highlight is designing and building REST APIs, which at least gets mentioned a lot in job postings. Lastly, I made sure to put myself as a developer that cares for quality in my cover letter by putting some emphasis on TDD and other engineering principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the highlight of this timeline must be this: &lt;strong&gt;I started blogging and putting time for personal projects&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is actually no coincidence that I started blogging more from beginning of July. My lack of progress in job search led me to find other avenues I can make progress in. Blogging was one of those avenues I wanted to invest myself more in, and also a relatively easy way to gain a sense of progress. For the same reason, I also started to do more programming in my own free time. While it isn’t the progress that I need, I felt it was tremendously helpful to gain a sense of momentum in life and also combating my imposter syndrome. I needed to not just feel, but know and see that I am capable of doing something I can take pride and ownership in. Had I not decided to start blog more or code on the side, I absolutely believe that it would have been much harder for me to push myself forward and continue job search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;to-be-continued&quot;&gt;To be continued&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post has gotten quite long already and I don’t want to bore you to death with my life story. So feel free to close off the tab now, I will post the next part in the future. If you managed to read up to here, honestly thank you for reading the diary entries of a man on the internet.

&lt;figcaption&gt;Poor man in a stock market exchange seems to be in pain, while I am writing a blog about my own journey with less pain&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few months I have been dipping my feet to some financial investment vehicles. I primarily invest in broad based market indices, with certain product tilts that I’ve chosen to be fit for myself. The point of this post is not to suggestany particular investment products or vehicles, but instead to share what I’ve personally learned as an individual as I continue to invest and re-think my own financial position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-i-invest&quot;&gt;Why I Invest&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going further to what I have learnt, giving a backstory would be beneficial to see where I am coming from. Currently my main reason for investing is for retirement. Now I’m pretty far away from any thoughts of wanting to retire or close to the expected retirement age which is 65 in Canada, 39 years away from the time of this writing. So you might ask if retirement is really something that I should be considering about, so here’s my pitch to why I think its an appropriate time for me to start considering it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310013401&quot;&gt;Statistics Canada&lt;/a&gt;, the life expectancy for a male of my age is around 78. Considering that I’m living in a pretty well-off country with social and health support I’ll assume that I can almost be assured to live to the age of 60. If I do manage to get to age 60, my life expectancy would be around 80 years old (and in general my life expectancy would increase as I continue to age). Now assume that I might want to have an early retirement at age 60, which is not uncommon to do, with the expectation that I will not have any income stream during my retirement. Additionally, say I want to have a spending power of 20k every year, for the next 20 years, then that means that I need to have 400k set aside. If I manage to save 1k for every month up to the year of my retirement, I would manage to save 408k, just barely meeting the 400k threshold. But this situation oversimplifies things as I haven’t calculated emergency spending, sickness, large payments such as buying assets, mortgage, pension income, income increase (or decrease) and many more. Suffice to say however, this quick calculation shows that relying on income and saving habits alone may mean that I may very well be short of my retirement income goal, and may mean less than desirable retirement days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lessons-i-learnt&quot;&gt;Lessons I Learnt&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve explained and hopefully convinced you why starting to plan for retirement as early as now is reasonable, I want to go over the lessons that I’ve learned. There are three categories: goal setting and planning, rationality and expectation, humility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goal-setting-and-planning&quot;&gt;Goal Setting And Planning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I approached investing as another source of income and a general way for me to get money. It is not wrong that I can get income, or at least appreciation of my capital, through investing, but over time I realized that having this generic hope of getting more money didn’t help me. It didn’t help me because I didn’t have anything in particular that I was trying to achieve, and while getting more income and money is good, I didn’t necessarily feel driven by it because I felt that I can get by with what I have without investing. It is only after I laid out what I want (the goal), and start to look at how I can achieve it (the planning), that I felt financial investing started to be more interesting and something I want to take seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goal setting and planning is not constrained to investments and financial activities of course, but financial health and planning can certainly help normalize the habit because it is often related to a familiar and quantifiable form which is money. Setting goals make, and sub-goals, makes even a long-term goal such as retirement more mentally acessible and approachable, particularly when paired with clear quantifiable metrics. It has also helped me in envisioning the time horizon of my activities (in this case my investment activities), which helps me to assess the decisions that I make and whether they are in line with what is demanded of my goal. If I know I need to save 1k every month to reach my minimum desired retirement days, then saving 500 for a month is a clear overstep of what is needed to achieve my goals. At the same time, knowing that I have a long time horizon for my goal means that I am learning to expect and include in my planning unexpected events, which helps me to further prepare in the face of such events and to develop flexible plans around such potentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rationality-and-expectation&quot;&gt;Rationality and Expectation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the resources I found and have been using frequently for my financial literacy and assessment is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/RATIONALREMINDER&quot;&gt;The Rational Reminder Podcast&lt;/a&gt;. The channel goes over a lot of decision making and thinking processes that aim to be as rational as possible (with acknowledgement that we are emotional and social beings). This way of thinking has really shaped my understanding of financial well-being as being founded upon sound and rational decisions &lt;em&gt;WITH&lt;/em&gt; appropriate expectations. What do I mean here by appropriate expectations? Well one simple example is packaged in the common saying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;past performance is not guarantee of future performance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s simply a statement that the past is not a perfect indicator of the future, which in hindsight is something that is easily agreeable. The problem is that a lot of the times our decision are heavily biased towards our past experiences, sidelining the evidences in front of us of the present situation. When investing it can be easy to fall in the trap of doubling down on a well performing asset in the past, thinking that its good performance will continue unabated. Or perhaps we would think we will be able to &lt;em&gt;pull out&lt;/em&gt; from our choice when things look sour, something extremely difficult to do correctly for the plain reason that we do not have a perfect oracle into the future, and our insight can be influenced by non-evidence based reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to goal setting and planning, I’m continuously learning to find reasonable expectations for my investments according to my goal. Since my goal is for the long-term I am setting up my investment positions to reflect that. Keeping this in mind has helped me to deal with the volatility shocks of the market. I cannot expect that my investment will continuously be increasing in value with such a long timespan, knowing that the market &lt;em&gt;IS&lt;/em&gt; volatile and &lt;em&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; be so in order to be profitable. It would be irrational of me to think otherwise, and likewise thus irrational of me to react as if it is unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, acknowledgement that there are elements out of my control in the performance of my investments is helping me to isolate the reasons for the results of my decisions. Often we think good results is an indicator of good decisions, which is not necessarily true, especially in an environment where there is little that you can do to affect the results such as the market. Therefore it has been a learning point for me to assess the quality of my decisions according to what is accessible, knowledge and affect-wise, to me. This certainly helps in moderating both my expectations and having a more appropriate reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;humility&quot;&gt;Humility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finance is definitely not my forte. When dealing with the market there are additional elements of social expectations, economics, politics, and many more, none of which are my forte. Trying to understand basic terminologies and concepts took me hours and some late night sleeps. I enjoyed them for sure, but it’s not easy, plus I’m definitely still far from being financially literate, at least to the degree that I want. Yet I still decide to invest into the market, because I (optimistically perhaps) believe that the information that I have found and learned has come from well-meaning and knowledgeable experts and that as a whole the market will perform adequately to grow its value. Combined with lessons learnt in adopting more rational expectations, I acknowledge that I am riding on the shoulders of giants. It is a humbling feeling knowing that there is so much more for me to know, and that I shouldn’t expect results are necessarily driven by my abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;finishing-words&quot;&gt;Finishing Words&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every lesson I’ve shared here has been eye-opening and I take them fully to heart. Though I spent the least in talking about it, the lesson of humility is likely the most important for me. I expect the lessons I’ve taken so far will be applicable in all aspects of my life and I am certainly looking forward to learn, and share, further lessons in my financial journey.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>btruhand</name><email>btruhand@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Poor man in a stock market exchange seems to be in pain, while I am writing a blog about my own journey with less pain</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">RIL - Request Body Buffering With Spring’s RestTemplate</title><link href="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2020/08/17/spring-resttemplate-request-body-buffering" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RIL - Request Body Buffering With Spring's RestTemplate" /><published>2020-08-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-08-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2020/08/17/spring-resttemplate-request-body-buffering</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2020/08/17/spring-resttemplate-request-body-buffering">&lt;h1 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using the Java Spring framework for my work for a while now. I started learning the Spring framework while building a REST API application which had to connect to other remote services through their own REST API interface. While the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#webmvc-client&quot;&gt;Spring RestTemplate&lt;/a&gt; is currently only in maintenance mode and expected to be deprecated completely in the future, it was the first thing that I found for making HTTP requests in the Spring framework. So I just started using it out of practicality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we often want to make log HTTP requests our servers make. One way is to put log statements everywhere we needed to make HTTP calls. One of the alternatives with Spring RestTemplate is to configure a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baeldung.com/spring-resttemplate-logging#logging-body-with-a-resttemplate-interceptor&quot;&gt;logging interceptor&lt;/a&gt;. This way we can configure a global (or several) RestTemplates that have configured logging capability.&lt;/p&gt;

	        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Response body: {}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
	        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking from the Baeldung post above, we can see that the signature for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;intercept&lt;/code&gt; method contains a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reqBody&lt;/code&gt; parameter of type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt;. This means that in order to log the outgoing request body, Spring has to serialize whatever we are sending to a byte array structure in-memory. Depending on the request body that you are sending this can cause memory issues, and perhaps even out of memory errors. Additionally it probably has performance impact to your application, even if a little. So it’s something that may need some considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The problem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in my current project I have to relay uploaded files made by clients to another service through its API call. These files will potentially be in gigabyte size range. Still using RestTemplate I realize immediately that the application will run out of memory if I logged using the interceptor above. So I decided to create two kinds of RestTemplate, one that can is configured to log requests automatically and another that doesn’t. Additionally I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/http/client/HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory.html#setBufferRequestBody-boolean-&quot;&gt;HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory.setBufferRequestBody(false)&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that the application will not buffer the uploaded file that needs to be relayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I was functionally testing the application I kept running to out of memory errors when uploading a 1.5 GB file and no matter what I did I could not fix it. After investigating further it turns out that I didn’t know the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html&quot;&gt;SpringBoot Actuator&lt;/a&gt; is available in the classpath. One of the things that the Actuator package provides is metric collection of outgoing HTTP clients made by RestTemplates, which is automatically provided if we build our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RestTemplate&lt;/code&gt; through the auto-configured &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RestTemplateBuilder&lt;/code&gt; provided by SpringBoot. That is if we created our RestTemplate like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Bean&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;RestTemplate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;restTemplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;RestTemplateBuilder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then the metric collection capability is automatically configured. And of course the metric collection is done by adding an interceptor, to be precise the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/metrics/web/client/MetricsClientHttpRequestInterceptor.java&quot;&gt;MetricsRestTemplateCustomizer&lt;/a&gt; is used. This interceptor is added to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RestTemplateBuilder&lt;/code&gt; I used above to build the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RestTemplate&lt;/code&gt;, and therefore all of my requests made with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RestTemplate&lt;/code&gt; that wasn’t configured for logging was actually buffering the request body! No wonder I kept hitting OOM errors…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-fix&quot;&gt;The fix&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well the fix is actually quite simple, I just built the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RestTemplate&lt;/code&gt; without the configured &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RestTemplateBuilder&lt;/code&gt; provided and everything is fine! Well… in the end I decided to move the application to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/reactive/function/client/WebClient.html&quot;&gt;WebClient&lt;/a&gt; instead. Not only it is the suggested API to use now, thus am building for a future proof application, I would still be able to log requests without having to be forced to buffer the request body. Though if I want to log the request body programmatically, I would still be required to buffer the request body, but that’s a separate issue for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>btruhand</name><email>btruhand@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Background</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Challenging Technology’s Social Free Lunch</title><link href="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2020/08/08/software-free-lunch" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Challenging Technology's Social Free Lunch" /><published>2020-08-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-08-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2020/08/08/software-free-lunch</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2020/08/08/software-free-lunch">&lt;p&gt;No, this blog post is not about how many software companies (and I think more and more in general) provide food budgets or cater free lunch or dinner to their workers. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;free lunch&lt;/code&gt; I mean here is an assumed and taken for granted property that technology has. Particularly a belief in technology as inevitably driving positive social progress and change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The belief that technology deterministically drives social progress (and implicitly social good or bad) has a name: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_determinism&quot;&gt;technological determinism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this view is held explicitly, but I do think at the corporate level there is definitely a sense that progress in technology is almost always contributing imore positively to the social good than negatively. At the very least we get that sense when we see the headlines regarding technology startups (often computer software/hardware related companies) are seen as the next greatest thing. Also how this optimism is priced in to their business valuation, and how they are marketed by the founders themselves when they pitch their companies. Some examples would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2020/02/10/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-orig.cnn-business&quot;&gt;Clearview AI founder asserting that his company is there for better law enforcement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-am-i-thinking-about-this-now&quot;&gt;Why am I thinking about this now?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I decided to go to university to study computer science my brother asked me, “why do you want to study computer science?” Back then I did not have any background in computer science, software or programming but I was quite decent in mathematics and I only know roughly that I computer science is related to math. I’ve also been a heavy user of computer throughout my life, so studying in computer science was a bit of a whimsical choice on my part. So I could only answer with “well I think it would be great to help people through software and computers” to which my brother responded with “But why do it through software and computer?” and there was no immediate reason that pops up in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an avid computer user, computers have been tremendously useful and beneficial throughout my life. Never have I really thought of the negative implications of computers and software (aside from my mum yelling at me for using the computer too much). As I become a software engineer I felt my optimism towards technology (software specifically) is further magnified. But we’ve seen how more recent stories, government bodies, social groups, and even the technologists themselves have become more critical towards technology’s social effect. They have started to not buy in to the social free lunch of technologies as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/codeland&quot;&gt;DEV’s CodeLand 2020&lt;/a&gt;, there was a talk titled &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Cost of Data&lt;/code&gt; by Vaidehi Joshi (you can CTRL+F to find it). Vaidehi gave a talk about how running your code on servers will lead to the use of electricity, which is often still generated by non-renewable energy sources. She went further and talked about the clean energy initiatives by top public cloud providers namely Amazon, Google and Microsoft. When the host and Vaidehi interacted after the talk, the host said: “The world of data and the world of climate change seems so far apart”. As software engineers I feel the same way, though I am intimately related to the creation of software and technology, its impact and its relations to the world around me can often elude me. While I focus in creating a software for a particular purpose, and often for what I believe as a good cause and purpose, I do not necessarily know and understand the full scope of the impact of the technology that I have created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mismatch between between an intimacy with creation and intimacy with effect is really the reason why I made this blog post. For this blog post I just want to create a more explicit awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;acknowledging-that-lunch-has-to-be-paid&quot;&gt;Acknowledging that lunch has to be paid&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skepticism towards technology is now more felt by me than ever before. Social progress and good is not so immediate and free anymore and efforts should be taken in order for the lunch to be properly given out. As technologists that create the technology I do think that I and many others are at the unique position to consider the kind of lunch that we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time I acknowledge that it is hard to do. Not just in mental capacity and knowledge, but also in execution. Many of us work for a company or a boss that has set upon us goals and visions that may constrain what we can do. We may not feel that we are at the right place to make these high-level decisions of social impact, which may very well affect the business. Perhaps we feel like speaking out our concerns will jeopardize our job and career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the end of the day someone will need to pay for the lunch. Someone has to put effort into creating a meaningful and desired social effect. I think it would be ludicrous for our stakeholders to bear the implicit costs of the products that we make. Imagine a grocery store that asks you to pay an explicit fee for the potential health complications you may contract from the ingredients they sell! Ludicrous I’d say. While I don’t think that technologists such as me has all the answers, and definitely not going to be the only one to be involved in the process, I do think we need to be more aware of it due to our unique position. Which I hope will translate to a more active participation in the construction of the desired social affects of the technologies that we build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, there’s really no free lunch.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>btruhand</name><email>btruhand@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">No, this blog post is not about how many software companies (and I think more and more in general) provide food budgets or cater free lunch or dinner to their workers.

&lt;p&gt;As my blog title says, this blog is a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scattering of thoughts&lt;/code&gt;. What does that mean? It means that this blog covers a range of topics and is really a representation of
the scattered thoughts and ideas in my mind. At the same time I made this blog as a way to self-improve and grow, whether it be in writing, blog creation,
self-advertising (though I’m not intending to heavily promote the blog as of the time of this writing) or technical matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence I thought up of a Rubik’s cube that is disentangled and ripped apart by a growing seed. The idea is that the Rubik’s cube is a structured confinement of
my thoughts in a logical form with many, but finite possibilities. By disentangling the Rubik’s cube from its structured form I hope to show the attempt to
“break free” from my current self, expanding my tightly held logics, thoughts, structures and experiences. At the same time it also serves the dual purpose of
the scattering of my thoughts in action. The seed is the seed of growth that enables this destructuring, and its blossom is a symbol of my growth. The animation too,
while entertaining, serves a purpose. Through a cycle of being structured and destructured, I acknowledge that as I grow there will be moments where I will settle
with the new me, and whenever those moments come, I would want to grow again. Hence, repeating the cycle ad infinitum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Trust me that this picture of clouds isn't randomly put here&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my career so far as a software engineer I have had 3 opportunities to be a mentor for someone that is more junior than me. Sometimes this junior-senior
status is established not necessarily by the capabilities and skills but more by my length of stay in the company. This was especially true when I worked in
Japan that is known heavily to promote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2019/08/24/editorials/reviewing-seniority-based-pay/&quot;&gt;seniority ranking&lt;/a&gt; of some sorts,
implicitly or explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that I have only been professionally in the field for 4 years, with no previous background to software programming before my
undergraduate, is something I find a bit surprising even for myself. I feel blessed to have had the opportunity so early in my career and in this blog post I
go over my experiences and thoughts on my role as a mentor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-first-mentee&quot;&gt;The first mentee&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was asked to mentor a new colleague six months into my first professional full-time career as a software engineer. By standards of total working experience this
colleague was actually more senior than me, but I just so happen to have worked in the company sooner than him. This mentee was also quite adept in his tech
skills, so aside from a few pointers about the team dynamics, projects, system overview I can’t actually remember any specific piece of technical knowledge that I
felt I was able to impart. Actually I remembered several times where I was surprised with what he showed me, for example a specific setup that he had for the
terminal-based text editor Vim. I have no shame in saying that I actually learned some things from my mentee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My relationship with this mentee was more akin to colleague buddies. We were both close in age and was very techno-optimistic (I’m less techno-optimistic now) and
think that technological advancement is always the best. We thought that impediments to technological progress is always bad. We bonded over the frustration of not
being able to use and try out more modern techniques or tools, because management would say its too risky. We would shrug them off as an evil that we needed to live
with and begrudgingly dreaded whenever we had to work with parts of the system that was deemed ancient (even by the really senior members in our team).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, my relationship as a mentor had to end because I was scouted by another team. There is an inherent idea in my head that the success of a mentor is in how much
one can impart their knowledge to the mentee and in this view I would say I had done a poor job as a mentor. But I take solace in thinking that I was a great
and relatable colleague, hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-second-mentee&quot;&gt;The second mentee&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit more than a year into my software engineering career I was again given the opportunity to mentor an incoming colleague. This time, my mentee was actually
just freshly started work as a professional software engineer. She also came from a more research oriented background, unlike my first mentee that came from a more
engineering oriented background. It was clear from the get go that as a professional she was very green in terms of software engineering standards and the practical
skills. I didn’t have to teach her to code, but at times I had to assist her in trying to understand one technical choice over the other. I do not know whether I
was actually being an effective mentor, but often my mentee would come to ask me for assistance for her own project. When I had time to spare I would ask how she’s
doing and ask if she needs assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around this time my attitude towards code quality was also becoming more bullish. Still coming off from the assumption that technical progress is important, as
important or if not exceeding at times to some business needs, I would at times be hellbent that some technical progress be included into a project. One such
example would be automated testing and basic CI/CD, which we were greatly lacking back then. To the credit of my persistence, and also some heavy silences during
team debates, gradually my team started to adopt some of the ideas that I kept throwing at them. It wasn’t perfect of course, and it wasn’t smooth or complete either,
but it got things going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on my code-quality-hellbent-saga I remember some times when I tried to directly impart this knowledge to my mentee, but uneffectively. I would tell her
to revise her code several times, and then may in the end revert some suggestions back. Why you may ask? Well it was because I was also trying to learn the thing
that I was trying to impart to my mentee. I had the drive yes, but I was rough in the edges and was more like a bulldoze trying to make its way through instead
of being more like a worker ant and learning with and encouraging my mentee. I’m sure my team had their frustrations with me too and probably felt confused
at times by my behaviour too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-third-mentee&quot;&gt;The third mentee&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third mentee is more recent. In terms of technical skills this mentee is somewhere in between the first and second mentee, still inexperienced overall but not a
blank slate. This time I have personally grown with regards to my technical skills from my time with my first and second mentee. I’ve refined my thoughts and experience
a bit more and had more time to polish it. I still hold some strong opinions regarding particular positions related to the software craft, but I think I can say
that I am more flexible than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also try to be more accommodating and reasonable for my mentee this time, trying to explain things a bit more slowly and showcasing more examples. However, I do
find myself to sometimes be a bit impatient with my mentee. It might be because of the experience that I had accumulated so far which makes certain things seem
simple and easy for me. So when my mentee is not able to keep up with me I would sometimes say to myself “why can’t he get this quickly?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a recent reminder that I’m not always right (and certainly not great) was when I was helping my mentee for the code design of a feature he was working on. At first
my mentee suggested a very simple solution that would get the job done, but I said it would be too inflexible for future changes and prone to breaking. My mentee
agreed, and tried out my solution, made some unit tests and it seemed fine, until it wasn’t when a more comprehensive integration test was conducted. Turns out I made
incorrect assumptions in my solution, and my mentee’s simpler solution would not have run to the same issue as mine. To be honest it did feel bad that not only was I
wrong but also I led my mentee to an incorrect solution, but am glad that overall I managed to resolve everything together with my mentee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;rounding-up-my-experience-so-far&quot;&gt;Rounding up my experience so far&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on my mentorship experiences so far here are some things that I have taken away:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is important as a mentor to actually be able to impart the skills that you are mentoring in. Being close colleagues with my first mentee was good, but I could
have been a much more effective mentor and support for my mentee had I had the skills to backup my position&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A mentor is a teacher in knowledge, methods and also in conduct. If a mentee is to learn from a mentor, then a mentor should reflect the correct posture to learning
and be open to the need for growing themselves&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Related to learning, I learned and am reminded that humility is so important, because we won’t get everything right. We need to learn with humility and open to admit
our mistakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish things off, there is a proverbial quote I like to say that goes like this (though I’m not sure where of its origins):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Above the sky, there is another sky&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will always be someone better than you, and so there is always room for you to improve and grow, even if you are a mentor and role model for someone&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>btruhand</name><email>btruhand@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Trust me that this picture of clouds isn't randomly put here</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Re-thinking Mocks</title><link href="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2020/07/04/rethinking-mocks" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Re-thinking Mocks" /><published>2020-07-04T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-07-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2020/07/04/rethinking-mocks</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2020/07/04/rethinking-mocks">&lt;p&gt;These days I have mainly been using Java for my professional career (roughly I have been working with Java for a year). I also mainly have been using the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/&quot;&gt;Spring framework&lt;/a&gt; along with its additional libraries at work. One of the things that
I enjoy with Spring is the dependency injection capability that it provides, primarily through the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@Autowired&lt;/code&gt; annotation. This quick and easy way to do dependency
injection is also further compounded in testing benefits as Spring also provides easy and seemless way to obtain these dependencies at test time (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@Import&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@ContextConfiguration&lt;/code&gt; to name a few) makes testing much easier. I also make a good amount of use &lt;a href=&quot;https://site.mockito.org/&quot;&gt;Mockito&lt;/a&gt; which makes my development
life much easier through &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mocks&lt;/code&gt;, and this post is about &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mocks&lt;/code&gt; and my experience and thoughts on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-are-mocks&quot;&gt;What are mocks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question has been covered in a variety of other posts out there, one of which I found most useful to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html&quot;&gt;Martin Fowler’s post&lt;/a&gt;. In the words of Martin Fowler himself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mocks use behavior verification, where we instead check to see if the order made the correct calls on the warehouse. We do this check by telling the mock what to expect during setup and asking the mock to verify itself during verification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of mocking is behaviour verification, which is the ability to assert what has &lt;strong&gt;happened&lt;/strong&gt; during the execution of a test, and not just what the system
under test has produced. Martin Fowler made a clear distinction and emphasis on this part which you can read up on his post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;quick-example&quot;&gt;Quick example&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ClassA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ClassB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dependency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;shouldDoFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ClassA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ClassB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dependency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;shouldDoFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;dependency&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dependency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;shouldDoFunc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;shouldDoFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;shouldDoFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;dependency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;doFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ClassB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;doFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// do something&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// test code below&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;test_func_whenShouldNotDoFunc_notCallDoFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ClassB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;classB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ClassB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ClassA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;classA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ClassA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;classB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;classA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;verify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;classB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;never&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;doFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above example is extremely contrived but it just barely shows the use case of mocks. The call to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;verify&lt;/code&gt; function says that we are trying to verify
that when &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shouldDoFunc = false&lt;/code&gt;, we expect that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ClassB.doFunc&lt;/code&gt; will not be called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative to using mocks above would be to supply an actual instance of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ClassB&lt;/code&gt; (not mocked) and check against the &lt;em&gt;results&lt;/em&gt; after calling &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ClassA.func&lt;/code&gt;.
Now in the above example no values are being returned from any of the function calls so no returned value can be expected, however often such functions causes
side-effects. Common side-effects include calling some API that causes some change, changing the environment settings, performing DB changes such as updates, changing
the state of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ClassB&lt;/code&gt; and many more. Such side-effects are testable and verifiable (if there are no side-effects performed by the function I question why the function
exists).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-positives-of-mocks&quot;&gt;The positives of mocks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my experience thus far using mocks is that it has been beneficial to create tests. Certain testing may require an expensive setup or verification procedure,
which makes tests run slow but also developed more slowly. An alternative to mocks may include creating fakes or stubs (a separate kind of testing entity), which may
also create additional development effort to make and also may require its own maintenance. Though a great deal of this benefit comes from the fact that many languages
have a well-tested and prevalent mocking library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mocks also makes creating truly &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;unit&lt;/code&gt; tests easier, and by unit here I mean tests that only put a single class/object under test. Mocks enable me to put the focus
and attention of tests on the specific unit under test and not have to worry about the other interacting pieces. In the example above, the test is made deliberately
about &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ClassA.func&lt;/code&gt; behaviour when it is in a certain state. In more complex objects under test, this makes some desired fine-grained testing much more approachable
and manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-negatives-of-mocks&quot;&gt;The negatives of mocks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest drawback using mocking is it requires whitebox testing, in order to verify using mocks we need to know what functions are being called, which essentially
bears down to knowing some level of detail about the implementation of the unit under test. Nowadays I think of this as &lt;em&gt;reflection for testing&lt;/em&gt;. Reflection is the
ability to inspect programming constructs at runtime of some code within the code itself. Often this involves passing in names of functions or fields in the form of
strings to specialized reflection APIs. Since access is made via strings, IDEs won’t help you during refactoring which makes mistakes during changes in the codebase
harder to detect. Thankfully a testing is one of the tools we have to safeguard ourselves against our programming mistakes, until the tests start to fail us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using reflection capabilities requires the programmer to have clear knowledge about what is and isn’t present and bake that knowledge statically into the code and
it is the same case when we use mocks. Now libraries like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mockito&lt;/code&gt; does enable the use of refactoring through IDE unlike reflection, but mocking doesn’t easily
allow us to change the tests when the dependency calls in the code under test changes. This creates a mismatch between expectation and reality. For example, if in
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ClassA&lt;/code&gt; above we change the call of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;doFunc&lt;/code&gt; to another function &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;doFunc2&lt;/code&gt;, the test would still pass but for very much the wrong reason! The reality is that
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;doFunc&lt;/code&gt; is no longer a dependency call being made, but the test still expects it as a call to be made and it just so happens the test was verifying that no calls
were to be made. The following test would fail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;test_func_whenShouldDoFunc_callDoFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ClassB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;classB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ClassB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ClassA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;classA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ClassA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;classB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;classA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;verify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;classB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;once&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;doFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but now the test fails for the wrong reason! The test will fail because the test is expecting the wrong thing, not because the unit under test is behaving
incorrectly. This is test maintenance drag. Martin Fowler calls this the coupling of implementation and testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;an-alternative-for-mocking&quot;&gt;An alternative for mocking&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the compelling alternatives to mocking is by supplying functions as parameters to the unit under test instead of whole object dependencies. The ability to pass
functions as parameters is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function&quot;&gt;First-class function&lt;/a&gt;. Consider this example in pseudo-Javascript&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;funcToTest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dependentFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dependentFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;test_funcToTest_whenConditionNotMet_doNotCallDependentFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// do something to cause condition to not be met&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;funcToTest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TestFailed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The passed in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dependentFunction&lt;/code&gt; is simply a function passed as a parameter that is called when some condition is met inside &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;funcToTest&lt;/code&gt;. Notice how in the test we
are also verifying the behaviour of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;funcToTest&lt;/code&gt; under some condition, similar to the example with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ClassA&lt;/code&gt;. In both the test using mocks and first-class function we
see that behaviour is being verified, and this should come as no surprise. We can think of objects as instances of namespaces/groupings for functions (with the ability
to maintain and collect some form of internal state) and so when we pass an object as a dependency it can be seen as passing in a collection of functions. The
difference is that when we use mocks we have to explicitly mention the dependent function we are interested in, while with first-class functions the dependent function
is stipulated in formal syntax (scratching off the fact that it’s possible to call functions without their parameters in Javascript). With mocks tests can fail/pass
for reasons of a mismatch between expectation and reality, with first-class functions that possibility is greatly diminished and if it happens is likely the
programmer’s mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However in reality I have not used first-class functions as an alternative to mocks at all. Much the reason is because it is much easier to work with objects and
mocks in Java. Though Java does have lambda functions and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/FunctionalInterface.html&quot;&gt;@FunctionalInterface&lt;/a&gt;
it is not that fluid to create classes and methods that take in first-class functions all the time. But this is surely a technique that I would explore and be more
conscious of in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>btruhand</name><email>btruhand@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">These days I have mainly been using Java for my professional career (roughly I have been working with Java for a year). I also mainly have been using the Spring framework along with its additional libraries at work. One of the things that I enjoy with Spring is the dependency injection capability that it provides, primarily through the @Autowired annotation. This quick and easy way to do dependency injection is also further compounded in testing benefits as Spring also provides easy and seemless way to obtain these dependencies at test time (@Import and @ContextConfiguration to name a few) makes testing much easier. I also make a good amount of use Mockito which makes my development life much easier through mocks, and this post is about mocks and my experience and thoughts on them.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Reflecting on racism and recent events</title><link href="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2020/06/07/reflecting-on-racism" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reflecting on racism and recent events" /><published>2020-06-07T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-06-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2020/06/07/reflecting-on-racism</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://btruhand.github.io/blog/post/2020/06/07/reflecting-on-racism">&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-this-post-about&quot;&gt;What is this post about?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the tragic death of George Floyd and the still ongoing protests as of this writing, I have been thinking and
reflecting on the issue of racism. While the issue and protest have been triggered within the North American cultural
context, the angle of my reflection is not restricted to the NA context. Partly because racism isn’t contained within
a particular culture, and also my own lack of understanding of the NA context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-now&quot;&gt;Why now?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m the type to take my time  trying to understand and grasp the subtleties of issues. Making this post is not an assertion
that I have gotten all the details pinned down, on the contrary it is my attempt to just start from somewhere, in my own way.
Some would say that I should have just immediately take some form of action and not be so caught up with how right or wrong
what I do is. I won’t argue with that sentiment&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, just that it’s not how I usually operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the tragedy that befell upon George Floyd, I likely won’t be making a post with this particular theme. Had recent
events not been so widespread, I also think I probably won’t have made a post specifically on this topic either. So the
creation of this post is also a result of being compelled to act due to my ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;have-i-been-subjected-to-racism&quot;&gt;Have I been subjected to racism?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. At least I do not feel that any of the treatments that I have received had been motivated by racism, intentional or not.
Perhaps the closest event to racism would be when I was with my friend speaking our mother tongue language. Apparently at
that time he overheard two people making near us to be making murmuring sounds which he said seemed to be
making an impersonation of our speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;am-i-racist&quot;&gt;Am I racist?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not think of myself as racist, but I doubt any person asked this would respond with an affirmative yes. But I realize
that when talking amongst my close friends that I do make racial remarks of our own group jokingly. I also know that I have
my own explicit racial presumptions. As someone with a bit of tanned color skin I did have my own phase of negatively viewing
my skin color. It was brief, but it was a moment of associating human worth with skin color and an ingredient for developing
racism through the lens of skin color. No one has said that I’m a racist, but that doesn’t mean that I have not been one,
acted as one, or exude the sense that I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;am-i-an-anti-racist&quot;&gt;Am I an anti-racist?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest the word &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;anti-racist&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is a first for me from reading and hearing the various resources over these past few weeks.
With regards to moral values I would say yes I am against anyone to be a target of racism. But I would not say that I have
spoken up against racism, especially not compared to the recent calling to denounce racism and being anti-racist. When
my friend pointed out to me the two people who he thought to be mimicking our speech I told him to let it be and to not
let it bother him too much. I wasn’t sure myself whether the two people were really making a mockery of our speech or not,
but at least reflecting back I should have stood up for my friend more, at least when I was consulting him and his feelings
of discomfort&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-stance-on-racism&quot;&gt;My stance on racism&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image …” - Genesis 1:26&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether by divine or natural commonality I believe that there is no difference in the intrinsic value between people of different
races, skin color, social standing and culture. Intrinsically, everyone is equally valuable and should be respected as such.
But in having this stance I sometimes forget the peculiarities surrounding one’s experience, the good and also their hardships.
As we live our lives and subject to our personal AND collective experience, we would pick up unique perceptions and also treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not having felt to have been a subject of racism makes me prone to the thought of dismissing certain identity roles in one’s
experience, including their race. Though, having given further thought to my own experiences and experiences, I would not
retract my foundational belief of the intrinsic worth of people. This is a point of growth that I would hope to continue further
as I continue life and interact with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;thoughts-on-violence-in-recent-protests&quot;&gt;Thoughts on violence in recent protests&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not one that would like to resort to violence. I can imagine myself being violent, I can imagine myself returning payback
violently to others, but I can’t imagine myself actually doing it. When I saw the violent death of George Floyd, I became
teary-eyed, and when I took the time to replay it over and over in video and in mind, I wept. But my tears are certainly different
from the tears of the black community who have experienced such physical abuse directly. My tears flowed because it was heart-wrenching
and clashed against my moral conscience, but the tears of those who are right in that situation is &lt;em&gt;AT LEAST&lt;/em&gt; the same as mine,
and more. So acknowledging that, while my ideals remain to be advocating non-violent response, I can understand the impulse and need
to unleash violence by some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it is difficult for me to come to terms morally to the use of violence. In fact, at times I have difficulties to come to
terms with being angry as one school drama teacher questioned my ability to be angry; “can you actually be angry for once?”
Compounded with the possibility and reality&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, that those who have enacted violence are not necessarily doing so with care for
others, whether they be the police or protesters, it becomes harder for me to square with the violence. While violence
has justified itself throughout history to play a central role in the development of humanity for better or worse, I just don’t
know if this is the time for violence for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;to-black-readers&quot;&gt;To black readers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not know how you perceive my writing. Is it with disdain? Disagreement? Disgust? Sadness? Regardless of what you think of me,
I want you to know that you matter, and that your life certainly matter. No one can say otherwise, and I hope you will always
bring that sense of worth with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;to-all-readers&quot;&gt;To all readers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in dealing with others’ experience, our mind starts churning. We start to rationalize others’ experience try in the name
of objectivity and critical thinking to break down experience into minute facts, of which is formed through our own understanding.
In doing so, when our understanding and experience is mismatch with the reality experienced by the other, we start to question
the legitimacy of their claims. As I underwent reflection for this post, countless times I have done this myself, putting myself
at the seat and lens of rationality. The progress of science have put a moral (or at least goodness) pedestal for objectivity,
the analytical mind, the scientist within us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But rewinding my senses to the time when I watched the video of George Floyd’s death it wasn’t objectivity that first shock me,
it was the sadness and the desire to scream &lt;strong&gt;STOP!&lt;/strong&gt; towards the police officers despite seeing it though a monitor. The first
thing that connected and captured us within the tragedy was not our mind, but our hearts and emotion. Yes, being analytical has its time,
but we are not animals of pure rationality either, having both thoughts and feelings. As such I hope we can all learn and continue to channel
our hearts and feelings for the compassion of others, as many of us would fail to understand the lived experience, but can still share
our emotions with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

I was certain of taking an
NLP (natural language processing) course and only need to take one more elective course besides that. The choice was between &lt;a href=&quot;https://coursys.sfu.ca/2020sp-cmpt-727-g1/pages/&quot;&gt;CMPT 727 - Statistical Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2020/spring/cmns/815/g100&quot;&gt;CMNS 815 - Social Construction of Communication Technologies&lt;/a&gt;. CMPT 727 would clearly complement the whole degree itself and would even go hand in hand with NLP, while CMNS 815 may be argued as more loosely tied to the degree and my overall career path. But I have made a similar decision before in my undergraduate years, between taking statistics or philosophy as my minor. I chose the uncommon philosophy as my choice, and in the same fate spirit as I did before I choise CMNS 815 as my last elective course to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My decision to take philosophy as my undergraduate minor were due to both my interest and benefits. With machine learning and data science on the rise, many would
probably I missed out on the opportunity as statistical capabilities would help me transition with more ease to such roles. Personally I disagree, firstly because
statistics is not something I’m particularly fond of learning (it is one of the more difficult areas of mathematics for me to get a handle on), and secondly
I felt that zoning in on a technical field would make me too technically inclined. I prefer to be more balanced and rounded in both discipline and worldview.
These same reasons apply when I chose CMNS 815 over CMPT 727. I knew that I am neither greatly interested in statistics or machine learning (I prefer building and
designing software) and that CMNS 815 would help me see technology in a broder social context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CMNS 815 in a nutshell was examining how technologies not just impact, but play a role in the shaping of society, cultures and worldviews. The technologies discussed
were not constraint to the technologies we are so wary of these days such as social media, surveillance cameras, computers but also to clocks, institutions, language
and many more things that in this day and age we would not immediately associate with the word “technology”. Perhaps it is better to replace “technology” with the term
“tools of life” to capture the broad sense of technology covered. But the course isn’t about isolating particular social phenomena or impact to a particular technology,
but it attempted to use particular case studies of technology to bring about understanding and appreciation of how technology &lt;em&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; impact society. Example of topics
include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;distributed agency, realizing objects (technologies) can express a form of choice and greatly affect our own sense of agency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the subtle yet powerful classifications made by technologies and their designers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the encoding of humanity in something that is not human, such as data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;importance and power of language and metaphors in how we think of the world including technologies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ethics and how technologists grapple with ethical needs and perceived moral stances&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;shaping behaviour through technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and many more…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-i-value-it-so-much&quot;&gt;Why I value it so much&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from my own interests the professor Sun Ha Hong who teched the course was clearly keen, knowledgeable and empathetic. Combined with my own personal interests,
it made the class much more enjoyable. The small class size (7 people in total) was also beneficial as thre were a lot of opportunities, designed or ad-hoc, to engage
with students and exchange pointers. Above all however is the diversity of topics, while also maintaining an approachable depth so as to not just be a skim of topics.
As a professional working in software, there are seldom any encouragement or endorsed professional opportunity to expand insights beyond the usual technical realm.
Having guidance in the vast discourse of social topics helps me expand my understanding and appreciation in a manageable way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a software engineer I wanted to be better at wrestling and engaging with the social consequences of my own work and the profession itself. I came to CMNS 815 with
that hope, and I felt it did better prepare me for future challenges. Certainly, the spotlights given by media these days pressured me to thinking that I should be
able to balance the ethical and social good with monetary results. But I am also of the conviction that positively navigating the social dilemmas of our creation
should be a nurtured and expected ability of software engineers. This course helped me forward to realize that conviction in my own professional life. Sure, the
chances of being asked about the social issues of technology in an interview will likely not crop up. Open discussion of them might not even happen reasonably often,
and my colleagues may show little interest. However, I see this knowledge and experience as my little edge over others, and I can proudly say that I am not afraid to
reflect on the muddy social issues of the software I had built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a culmination of what I had learnt I wrote a paper on cryptocurrency and trust (maybe I will cover it in some future time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-recommendation-to-you&quot;&gt;My recommendation to you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are an SFU student and you can afford to take this course, take this course. If you happen to find a similar course somewhere else take it. I’m obviously biased,
and well aware that such my fellow software engineers (or perhaps technologists in general) are not really inclined to take such courses. I understand, between
learning something that can have immediate clear gains to your professional and personal life (learning some new language) vs a course like CMNS 815, many would choose
the former. Yet I can’t help to recommend this course least because of the knowledge and experience I had gained, and more so due to how I throughly enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>btruhand</name><email>btruhand@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">For my final term at SFU for the Big Data specialization masters program I was at a decision junction between several courses I can take.
