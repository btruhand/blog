### Me
Hi, my name is Btara Truhandarien and the author of this blog. Professionally I am a software engineer/developer and have been so for the past
5 years. I graduated from University of Waterloo, Canada for my undergraduate and completed a professional masters program in Simon Fraser University.
Before taking the masters program I was working in Japan. Fun fact: I am neither Canadian nor Japanese, but Indonesian, so I'm happy to say that
I have been fortunate to be able to experience life through different perspectives and lenses.

My hobbies and off-work activities are quite basic. I spend my time doing either of these:
- reading news
- reading articles, opinion pieces (I enjoy pieces with philosophical considerations the most)
- reading fantasy novel
- cooking
- gaming (I enjoy RPGs the most, and action second, and I am unfit for FPS I would say)
- learning something technical 

I would say what I do is quite similar to what you probably do, so I hope this gives you the sense that you can connect when reading my posts

### This blog

While I'm a software person, this blog is less about my technical expertise and posts. Instead this blog is more about the less technical matters
but what I think is at least equally important. You will find a lot of my posts to be philosophical and full of pondering, with no immediate
signs of resolution. Indeed, this blog will be a storehouse of my thoughts and opinions on world events and issues. Some things I post may not
resonate with you but I hope you will still derive some value from it. Right now I don't open a comment section for my posts, but please feel
free to send me an e-mail about any of my posts. Oh and yes, I do make more technical-oriented posts once in a while. 

The blog is also made as a way for me to own some piece of work, instead of having to rely on a platform such as Medium. It's an exercise of ownership.
It also has the advantage of being more customizable.

Whatever you read here, I hope you will gain benefits from it.
